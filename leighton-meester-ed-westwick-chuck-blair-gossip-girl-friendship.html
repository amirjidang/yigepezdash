Who's still friends with whom? It's already well-known that Leighton and Blake don't really chat, but what about Leighton and her on-screen beau <a href=#>Ed Westwick?</a></p><p><strong>Updated on December 21, 2021, by Michael Chaar:</strong> Leighton Meester and Ed Westick played the notorious Chuck and Blair on the hit CW series, Gossip Girl. Despite having insane on-screen chemistry, and Ed claiming he was madly in love with Leighton during their time filming, the two never really dated in real life. Luckily for Gossip Girl fans, the two are still friendly, and Ed even spoke out regarding their relationship this past year, claiming it was "hard not to fall in love with her," during their time working together. While Ed is currenly single following his split from Tamara Francesconi this past September, Leighton is happily married to Adam Brody, whom she tied the knot to back in 2014. The couple later welcomed their first child together, Arlo a year later in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-westwick-claims-he-loves-leighton-meester>Ed Westwick Claims He Loves Leighton Meester</h2><p>As for how the real-life actors felt about one another, Ed Westwick told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E! Online</a> in 2012 that he and Chuck were both head over heels for Leighton/Blair.</p><p>He admitted to the interviewer, "I'm madly in love with Leighton, so that's what helps on my behalf, maybe so much that she doesn't even have to be in love with me. I love enough, she's mine."</p><p>But don't get it twisted, folks; he didn't mean in a romantic way. At least, we don't think he did... After all, Leighton's married these days, so clearly, she wasn't destined to be Ed's real-life Blair.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ed elaborated, "I'm incredibly close with her, she's a lovely girl. I think she was 20 and I was 19 when we started the show and it's such a kind of development stage of young adulthood. And to grow up on the show and to go through that together, you know you're going to have a very strong bond."</p><p>Clearly, the way Ed felt about Leighton helped make their on-screen chemistry even more believable. Fans lamented that though the pair had tons of drama, "Chair" was always end-game to viewers. Despite the toxicity they sometimes experienced, Chuck and Blair were the dream couple of the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ed-and-blair-still-have-love-for-one-another>Ed And Blair Still Have Love For One Another</h2><p>Ed also praised Leighton's acting chops, saying "she is a remarkable talent and there is just sometimes you can't put things into words with connections or sparks or when you're acting with someone. We've got the right pairing, I guess." Ed Westwick went on to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">declare his love for Leighton</a> in 2021, claiming that it was "hard not to fall in love with her," and we don't blame him!</p><p>Not everyone had such a great time on Gossip Girl, of course. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively even said she felt compromised by the show</a>. Which could be why none of the original cast is yet slated for the new series, which officially aired this year!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though, the creators have left things open in the Gossip Girl universe; it's possible that some of the characters fans know and love could resurface and enter the storyline. Who wouldn't want to see Leighton and Ed co-star once again? We're sure Adam Brody won't mind.</p><h2 id=leighton-meester-is-married-with-kids>Leighton Meester Is Married With Kids</h2><p>Despite having the best chemistry with Ed Westick during their time filming Gossip Girl, Ed and Leighton remained friends and friends only. While Ed is currently single, aftering having <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">split up with his girlfriend of two years</a>, Tamara Francesconi in September, Leighton is happily married.</p><p>Leighton married The OC star, Adam Brody back in 2014, leaving fans of both shows obsessed with their pairing. Since then, the duo have expanded their family and welcomed their first child together, Arlo Day Brody a year later in 2015, proving themselves to be quite the happy family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter Reacts To The New Cast Of The 'Gossip Girl' HBO Max Reboot</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnqGXncGwuoymnJ6rpJq%2FbrHDZq6eq6SstqS3jJyfrpubYq%2BtrcirZKCno6i2sXnGoqmlZZantqa6w6yfoqhf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
