One in particular took place during the pitch for the product, Toor. Kevin O'Leary and Barbra Corcoran invested, while Mark Cuban understood the appeal of the product. As for Chris Sacca, he was very critical about the product and its "technology."</p><p>We'll take a look back at what went down, and how the debate between the two sides went.

We've seen the sharks enthusiastic over a deal, while on the flip side, fans have also seen the sharks go at it over a particular pitch. Looking back at some of the more problematic moments, Toor from season 8 will always come to mind. Barbara Corcoran and Mark Cuban seemed very interested in the technology, which allowed buyers the opportunity to visit a home with automatic unlock technology. However, not all of the sharks were impressed. Chris Sacca in particular felt like the product already existed, and that Toor was just a fancy, and overpriced replacement.</p><p><strong>Despite his feelings about the product, Kevin O'Leary and Corcoran agreed on a deal. Credit to Junior Desinor</strong>, who gave a terrific presentation, and was a major reason as to why a deal was reached.</p><p>Even after the deal was made, Sacca was still going after his fellow sharks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Sacca tells Cuban and Corcoran, "I've already seen the next tech out there, it's there, I used it last week." Cuban responds, "That's not true, That's degrading to him because the key isn't the software, the software is the easiest part. How stupid are you?"</strong></p><p>Sacca continued that with one new line of code, any technology could duplicate Toor.</p><p><strong>Sacca concluded, "Good luck guys, I wish you get your money back. I sometimes wonder how you made all that money Mark."</strong></p><p>At that point, Cuban rolls his eyes and the footage cuts. Who knows if the two continued their argument at that point, but ABC clearly had enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>1:58</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/your-paragraph-text-2024-06-05t131600-226.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Shark Tank's Most Expensive Deal In History Crashed And Burned">Shark Tank's Most Expensive Deal In History Crashed And Burned</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Kevin O'Leary spent millions on a particular product, but saw it crash and burn during a presentation with Costco.</p><p>Looking back at the ordeal, one of the most liked comments on YouTube credited Junior Desinor for his presentation, and how he shifted the sharks his way.</p><p>"That second guy is the perfect salesman. He exudes confidence, seems in control and had a charming way of answering every question. This guy needs to do courses and train people to get these Skills he has."</p><p>Lots of fans sided with Mark Cuban at the time.

It was an attractive deal. However, as of early 2023, Toor went under, and wasn't available for purchase. Looper updated on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">what happened to Toor</a>, and it was revealed that Desinor completely switched paths.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Looper writes, "Recent updates on Desinor's life show that he's opened a brick-and-mortar CBD store with his wife in Dallas, Texas.

Because of this, it should be pretty easy to track who didn’t return the key."</li><li>"A lot of houses have smart locks on them, especially new builds. You can send a realtor or potential buyer a 1 time code to get in the house, which is basically what TOOR was except you had a hard key. And let’s face it, most people selling a house don’t want random people in their house taking a tour without supervision, which was this guys pitch."</li><li>"Ring, SimpliSafe, among others can all do the same thing roughly.

According to the Sony hack, <a href=#>Cuban was insulted by ABC's initial offer</a> to appear on Shark Tank under the salary. Cuban made it clear, they were very far apart.</p><p>"Seriously? no chance... this is beyond an insult and it shows no one cares about the investments I have made or the entrepreneurs."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Mark-Cuban.jpg><p>Cuban went on to admit the email wasn't unlike something he'd say in public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's nothing I wouldn't have said publicly. If they want me to continue to do 'good television' and make investments that I like to do but that I otherwise would not have done or would not have been accessible to me, then it's a decision they have to make. And if we don't come to a resolution, I'll leave the show."</p><p>Cuban was clearly worth every penny, becoming a fan favorite on the show. Entrepreneurs have also loved Cuban throughout the years.</p><p>Sadly, his time on the series is coming to an end, as Cuban announced he only has one season left on Shark Tank. He'll clearly be missed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoZmioHq1rc2kZJytpGKzsLvTmp6eZZ2Wv6x5wq6ZmqZdo7K1edaoqa2gXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
