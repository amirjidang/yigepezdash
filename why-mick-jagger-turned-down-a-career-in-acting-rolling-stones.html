The English artist is so accomplished in his work that he earned the highest accolade a citizen from his nation can achieve - a knighthood from the Queen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jagger is best known for his music, but he has also ventured into the world of film through the years; working as an actor and a producer. For all his decades' worth labor, the 78-year-old is estimated to have a net worth of about $500 million today, <a href=#>which compares favorably</a> to some of his peers in showbiz. On top of all his career accomplishments, Jagger can also boast of having a big, blended family. <a href=#>He currently has eight children</a> from five different mothers, but he is often praised as being a present and loving dad.</p><p>The Dartford-born musician might have had an even more distinguished career and life, had he been more immersed in acting work.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Who Are Mick Jagger's Children?</a></span></p><h2 id=mick-jagger-39-s-music-career><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Mick Jagger's Music Career</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mick Jagger comes from the age of Britain's rock and pop band golden generation. The Beatles, Queen, and The Rolling Stones are often referred to as The Greatest 3 bands of their time. Jagger has been the lead of The Rolling Stones since the band was formed in 1962. In that time, they have released a total of 30 studio albums together.</p><p>Jagger has recorded four studio albums on his own, the last of which Goddess in the Doorway and was released in 2001.</p><h2 id=mick-jagger-as-an-actor><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mick Jagger As An Actor</span></h2><p>Mick Jagger's love for the silver screen is unquestionable, as it is a field he has invested considerable time and resources into. His acting career is described as 'intermittent,' however, as he has almost always prioritized his music over playing movie or TV characters in front of the camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He first started acting in 1970, with his most recent screen role being in the 2019 crime thriller film, The Burnt Orange Heresy, alongside the likes of Claes Bang, Elizabeth Debicki and Donald Sutherland.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>A Big Concert Is coming!

The two biggest roles of his career came in that year: in the crime drama Performance, and in the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Australian Ned Kelly</a> biopic of the same name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In Performance, he played a character called Turner, described as "a reclusive, eccentric former rock star who has lost his demon." Despite originally receiving mixed reviews, the Donald Cammell and Nicolas Roeg picture is now regarded as one of the best films ever in the history of British cinema.</p><h2 id=mick-jagger-was-approached-to-feature-in-39-dune-39><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Mick Jagger Was Approached To Feature In 'Dune'</span></h2><p>Before the 2021 epic sci-fi film Dune swept multiple major accolades - even before David Lynch's 1984 adaptation of the Frank Herbert novel - Mick Jagger nearly became immortalized as part of the universe. Chilean-French director Alejandro Jodorowsky approached him to play the character Feyd-Rautha in a film that he was to make based on the book.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although this was not one of the roles that Jagger turned down, Jodorowsky's picture never got made and is now at times referred to as "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the greatest sci-fi film never made</a>."</p><h2 id=why-mick-jagger-turned-down-major-acting-roles><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why Mick Jagger Turned Down Major Acting Roles</span></h2><p>For the most part, Mick Jagger's aversion to accepting movie parts after his original fast start simply came down to the quality of roles he was being offered. "There aren’t that many great parts, to be honest," he said in a recent interview. "You get offered a lot of rubbish. In the ’70s and ’80s, there was a lot of prejudice against musicians being actors."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the same time, whenever good roles would come around, scheduling conflicts with his band's tour dates would often mean he chose the latter. The 1982 West German film Fitzcarraldo is an example of this, as the singer dropped out of shooting and forced the director to drop his character out of the script altogether.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why David Lynch Isn't Interested In Seeing The 'Dune' Remake</a></span></p><h2 id=mick-jagger-recently-wrote-the-theme-for-39-slow-horses-39-on-apple-tv><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Mick Jagger Recently Wrote The Theme For 'Slow Horses' On Apple TV+</span></h2><p>Although not quite an active actor these days, Mick Jagger will never be found too far from the world of film and television. He is the brains behind Strange Game, the theme song for Apple TV+'s new spy thriller series, Slow Horses.</p><p>On his Instagram page, Jagger expressed his delight at having been part of the creative team for the project. "I really enjoyed creating the theme track for Slow Horses with Daniel Pemberton…hope you enjoy it!" he wrote, in part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rolling-stones-have-also-licensed-their-songs-for-film-and-tv><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Rolling Stones Have Also Licensed Their Songs For Film And TV</span></h2><p>Other than original themes, Mick Jagger's music has actually been a staple of both small and big screen for decades. The Rolling Stones have licensed a variety of their songs for use in various movies and TV shows.</p><p>"Sometimes it’s weird if you’re in the middle of enjoying a movie, or not enjoying a movie, and suddenly one of your songs comes on, if you’ve forgotten you licensed it," the rock-star is quoted saying on a piece <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about his acting work</a> by MSN.</p><h2 id=mick-jagger-is-a-filmmaker-himself><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mick Jagger Is A Filmmaker Himself</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from acting as well as writing and licensing music for movies and TV shows, Mick Jagger is a bona fide filmmaker and producer. His first producing gig was in 1987, in the adventure film Running Out of Luck, in which he also starred in.</p><p>In 1995, he founded a production company called Jagged Films, which has since been responsible for movies such as Enigma, Being Mick (both 2001), The Women (2008), and the Chadwick Boseman-led James Brown biographical musical film, Get on Up.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Watch Mick Jagger Prove He's Still Got The Moves At 78</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdorakt4yjmKCflad6tcHRp5ydZZSkxK95wGaamqqVmr9utc1mmJysmaO0br7OpaOippdiwLW7zZ6qaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
