"I'm still young and it's fun… I don't feel like I missed out on things.</p><p>"Sometimes, I'm just like, 'Geez, Egypt… maybe if mommy would have had you a little bit later…. [But] she is my motivator," continues Paris, who performs seven times a week in the Minneapolis production of Rent (her mom, Jamecia, also stars in the show). "Now when I hit the stage, I'm not only living for myself, I'm living for another human being."</p><p><a href=#>See which Idol stars are engaged!</a></p><p>Egypt, now 17 months old, is "the happiest baby you'll ever meet," Paris gushes to <strong>Us</strong>.</p><p>"She walks, she talks, she loves Dora the Explorer. She's very, very smart. We're potty training right now," Paris says of her daughter, whose first word was "Hey!"</p><p><a href=#>Check out adorable photos of real-life babies who look like celebrities!</a></p><p>Paris says Egypt also loves to sing along to <strong>Beyonce</strong>'s "Single Ladies" and even earned the nickname "The Slapper" because she's so feisty with Paris' little brothers, Jamez, 6, and Shakur, 12.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She still has not revealed the identify of the father, whom she split from when Egypt was 1 year old.</p><p>"Finding out I was pregnant made me become more mature. It takes guys awhile to grow, and I don't think his maturity level grew," she tells <strong>Us</strong>. "It felt like I was teaching him as well as trying to learn on my own how to be a parent. That was hard."</p><p>They still have a good relationship. "I would never want her not to see him, or not be around him. Every child needs their dad," she says.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGafoaKowW68yJxkmqWVp7akrc1moJ2nnKh6sa3RoqpmmpWju6bA02aqoaenqHqwssVmm5qtl53Bpr6Mnp6yqKRif3F9j2tta2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
