From the heights of YouTube fame to opportunities to branch out into various brands, and rub elbows with various celebrities, Westbrook has really made a place for herself in the beauty streaming community.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The real question, though, is how much is she worth after all that hard work and building up a rabid fan following? Let's start with the basics.</p><h2 id=is-tati-a-makeup-artist>Is Tati A Makeup Artist?</h2><p>Her title has changed over the years, and Tati Westbrook may not consider herself a makeup artist these days. At least, not primarily. Her top title? "American internet personality" -- followed by YouTuber, businesswoman, and&nbsp;then makeup artist.</p><p>She probably much prefers the title of "mother of the YouTube beauty community" rather than the less exciting role she used to go by. Besides, it's clear that most of Tati Westbrook's net worth stems from her notoriety as a YouTuber.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From ad revenue to sponsorship opportunities, Westbrook has built up her net worth to somewhere around $13 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources say</a>. That cash flow doesn't come from plain old YouTube, though.</p><h2 id=does-tati-westbrook-have-a-makeup-line>Does Tati Westbrook Have A Makeup Line?</h2><p>Westbrook actually owns both a makeup line (Tati Beauty) as well as a supplement brand (Halo Beauty). Those two brands are part of where her income flows from, and of course, having a following on social media definitely helps bump the sales up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Why You Don't Hear Much About James Charles Anymore" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why You Don't Hear Much About James Charles Anymore</a></span></p><p>She doesn't necessarily run all her businesses and do all the work on her own, though. Her sponsorship deals generate a great deal of wealth, and that&nbsp;has to be Tati on camera.&nbsp;Those deals average thousands of dollars, sources say, with her supplement branding raking in $100s of $1000s per year.</p><p>Fans argue that her controversy with James Charles spurred a lot of Tati's following to either join up even harder, pitchforks in hand, or ditch her entirely. Such is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the life of a controversial YouTuber</a>, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-tati-s-husband-do>What Does Tati's Husband Do?</h2><p>In an interesting twist, Tati's husband, who has been by her side throughout her rise to fame, has a bit of a hand in the business, too. James Westbrook is apparently a business partner of his wife's, and he's previously worked in the entertainment industry and has even run an agency.</p><p>Clearly, he knows a lot about business, as Tati has elaborated, and that has helped the married pair grow both of their net worths. Of course, things did go downhill recently, even though Tati Westbrook has been flying under the radar in the beauty 'Tubing world.</p><p>In fact, she reportedly sold her home to afford a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lawsuit brought against her</a> and her husband by their co-founders at Halo Beauty. Westbrook noted that her "integrity" was more important than her net worth -- and she's not afraid to build back up from the bottom.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Did The Bulk Of Jeffree Star's Net Worth Really Come From YouTube?" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Did The Bulk Of Jeffree Star's Net Worth Really Come From YouTube?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmqyZYsSmv9Obqainm2K7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
