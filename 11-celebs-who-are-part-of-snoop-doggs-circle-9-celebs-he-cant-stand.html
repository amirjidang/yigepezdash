That number does not even begin to account for his music career, especially given that Mr. Snoop Doggy Dogg has just released his 15th album this year. Most musicians do not even last a mere 15 songs or 15 seconds of radio play in this industry, let alone 15 albums off of a career that already spans several decades and counting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Needless to say, Snoop D-O-double-jizzle has lived a long and fulfilling life, but with any life like his, he was always bound to make a bevy of enemies. Of course, he has made plenty of life long friends along the way as well, but if Zuckerberg has taught us anything, it is that no one gets to 500 million friends without making some enemies along the way.</p><h2 id=loves-pharrell><span class=item-num>20 </span><span><strong>Loves: Pharrell&nbsp;</strong></span></h2><p>Pharrell and Snoop Dogg have been friends and frequent collaborators for years now.&nbsp;While Snoop admitted in an interview with The Guardian that Pharrell "loves to critique" him, Snoop appreciates all of the constructive criticism. It's a big reason why they've made countless hits together, like "Beautiful" and "Sensual Seduction."</p><h2 id=loves-seth-rogen><span class=item-num>19 </span><span><strong>Loves: Seth Rogen</strong></span></h2><p>It is not hard to figure out just why Snoop Dogg and Seth Rogen are such good friends or what the "one thing" is that they have in common. However they bonded, the bond is strong enough that they are always hanging out and Rogen even guest-starred on Snoop's talk show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-ricky-harris><span class=item-num>18 </span><span><strong>Loves: Ricky Harris</strong></span></h2><p>For those unfamiliar with the name, Ricky Harris was an actor and comedian who knew Snoop Dogg ever since the two were childhood friends. The two even starred in a movie together, called Bones. At the age of 51, following a heart attack, Harris passed away. Snoop attended his funeral.</p><h2 id=can-t-stand-ricky-harris-cousin><span class=item-num>17 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Ricky Harris' Cousin</strong></span></h2><p>Speaking of Harris' funeral, when Snoop arrived to the funeral, he was attacked. Footage from Sherri Shepherd (yes, from The View) documented the event on social media. TMZ went on to report that the fight started when Snoop was attacked by Harris' cousin. No arrests were made because all parties fled the scene when the cops arrived.</p><h2 id=loves-wiz-khalifa><span class=item-num>16 </span><span><strong>Loves: Wiz Khalifa</strong></span></h2><p>Much like the aforementioned Seth Rogen, Wiz Khalifa has a very mutual love of a certain 'plant' that he shares with Snoop Dogg. It inspired both men to bond and not only produce music together, but also star in the film Mac and Devin Go To High School as the title characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-t-stand-colby-covington><span class=item-num>15 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Colby Covington</strong></span></h2><p>For as long as he has been in office (maybe longer), the President of the United States has been on Snoop Dogg's radar. Snoop is not a fan of him or his supporters, so when he saw Colby Covington of UFC infamy in full support of him while rocking a MAGA hat, Snoop was none too pleased.</p><h2 id=loves-david-beckham><span class=item-num>14 </span><span><strong>Loves: David Beckham</strong></span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg first met David Beckham when the latter guest-starred in an episode of the former's Father Hood reality show, and sparks flew between the odd couple. They're such good friends that - as Beckham said in a 2010 Associated Press interview - Snoop let Beckham be one of the first to listen to his album as soon as it was finished.</p><h2 id=can-t-stand-darren-till><span class=item-num>13 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Darren Till</strong></span></h2><p>As mentioned earlier, Snoop is not a fan of Colby Covington. He was so blinded by rage for the man one time that Snoop cursed all kinds of vulgarities at Darren Till and making fun of him for losing to Tyron Woodley, mistaking Till for Colby. Till was none too pleased, and threw some vulgarities of his own in Snoop's direction after the fact on Twitter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-martha-stewart><span class=item-num>12 </span><span><strong>Loves: Martha Stewart</strong></span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg's unapologetic love for Martha Stewart and the love she shares for him in return has been well documented. They met on a 2008 episode of Martha Stewart's show. Then, they continued to bump into each other and hang out so often after that a full-blown friendship blossomed.</p><h2 id=can-t-stand-suge-knight><span class=item-num>11 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Suge Knight</strong></span></h2><p>Snoop has since buried the hatchet with Suge Knight, but once upon a time ago, he seriously could&nbsp;not stand his former Death Row label mate. Since breaking away from him and growing to hate Suge's ownership over the label and Snoop's own music, Snoop has dissed Suge on songs like "Pimp Slapp'd"</p><h2 id=loves-sasha-banks><span class=item-num>10 </span><span><strong>Loves: Sasha Banks</strong></span></h2><p>Sasha Banks is a wrestler and former Women's Champion currently employed by WWE. Snoop has always been an avid fan of wrestling and, therefore, is in full support of Sasha (who also happens to be Snoop's real-life cousin). He performed her theme song at WrestleMania in 2016 and more recently produced new theme music for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-t-stand-josh-scobee><span class=item-num>9 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Josh Scobee</strong></span></h2><p>After the Pittsburgh Steelers lost a football game to the Baltimore Ravens in 2015, Snoop Dogg (a passionate Steelers fan) blamed their NFL kicker Josh Scobee for the loss. As a result, the rapper took to social media and said some not too kind words about the former Jacksonville Jaguar.</p><h2 id=loves-the-game><span class=item-num>8 </span><span><strong>Loves: The Game</strong></span></h2><p>As two Los Angeles natives, Snoop Dogg and fellow rapper The Game both have a close-knit bond. Their bond over LA is so strong that after a week of violence, the two led a peaceful march on to LAPD HQ to initiate a dialogue with the police to discuss possible safe solutions for the LA area.</p><h2 id=can-t-stand-paul-gascoigne><span class=item-num>7 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Paul Gascoigne</strong></span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg threw the first shot at Paul Gascoigne when he posted an Instagram picture of the former soccer player and manager, then blamed drinking for his bad aging. Gascoigne posted something similar for Snoop on Twitter, blaming smoking for Snoop's aging. He then posted some mean tweets about the rapper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=loves-dr-dre><span class=item-num>6 </span><span><strong>Loves: Dr. Dre</strong></span></h2><p>Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg's relationship has been as thick as thieves together for the past several decades. Some of their biggest hit records have been collaborations they made with each other. The success they have manifested from their music has helped them become real-life friends over the years.</p><h2 id=can-t-stand-iggy-azalea><span class=item-num>5 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Iggy Azalea</strong></span></h2><p>It all started when Snoop Dogg, trying to be funny, posted a&nbsp;series of mean memes about Iggy Azalea to his&nbsp;'gram. Iggy responded with an angry Twitter rant which later got deleted and used as ammo for more Insta comedy from Snoop. Iggy wound up posting some memes of her own, including one implying Snoop looked terrible.</p><h2 id=loves-eminem><span class=item-num>4 </span><span><strong>Loves: Eminem</strong></span></h2><p>Snoop Dogg may possibly respect Eminem more than he does any other rapper. He carries so much respect for Em that he's gone on record in saying - from a 2014 interview - that he could never have Eminem on his album because his "Renegade" verse with Jay-Z showed him he'd get out-rapped on his own songs by an Eminem guest feature.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=can-t-stand-kanye-west><span class=item-num>3 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand: Kanye West</strong></span></h2><p>Much for the same reasons he cannot stand Colby Covington, Snoop Dogg cannot stand Kanye West for being a supporter to the President of the United States of America. As recently as last month, Snoop has said mean things about Kanye and his "jail slippers," as he called the designer's Yeezy Crocs on Instagram.</p><h2 id=loves-minister-farrakhan><span class=item-num>2 </span><span><strong>Loves: Minister Farrakhan</strong></span></h2><p>Back in May, Minister Louis Farrakhan was kicked off of both Instagram and Facebook for what was deemed "dangerous" speech. In response, Snoop Dogg told all of his&nbsp;IG followers to&nbsp;support him and "show some love to a real brother" by posting their favorite Farrakhan videos all over social media.</p><h2 id=can-t-stand-lapd><span class=item-num>1 </span><span><strong>Can't Stand:&nbsp;LAPD</strong></span></h2><p>From his own arrests and run-ins with the law to the mistreatment he has viewed firsthand from the police, Snoop Dogg has always been vocal (both in interviews and in songs) on his disdain for the Los Angeles Police Department. His disdain was reason enough why he agreed to usher a peaceful protest at LAPD HQ with The Game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: theguardian.com, tmz.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoamWTmrmmrtJmrqGnXZa%2FpnnPmqmtZZ%2BberS6zqinZpyfnLS0ecKiqZyklWKGbq%2FEpZybq12dsm6vwKerZquklrulew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
