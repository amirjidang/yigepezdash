Since its inception, the band’s line-up has consisted of Matthew Murphy (lead vocals, guitar, keyboards), Tord Øverland Knudsen (bass, backing vocals), and Dan Haggis (drums, backing vocals). The band is signed to 14th Floor Records and Bright Antenna. They have sold over 1 million copies worldwide.</p><p>The group met while they were students at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts and released several EPs before their 2006 album <i>Girls, Boys and Marsupials</i>, which was released only in Japan. Their debut studio album, <i>A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation</i>, was released in 2007 and featured some tracks first released on <i>Girls, Boys and Marsupials</i>. After releasing another EP in 2008 and touring for three years, the band released their second album, <i>This Modern Glitch</i>, in 2011. Their third album, <i>Glitterbug</i>, was released in 2015. The band released their fourth album, <i>Beautiful People Will Ruin Your Life</i>, on 9 February 2018.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=history></span>History<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=early-years-and-debut-album-2003%e2%80%932008></span> <span id=Early_years_and_debut_album_.282003.E2.80.932008.29></span>Early years and debut album (2003–2008)<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>The three band members met in 2003, while they were studying at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts; they soon became friends and formed the band. Murphy and Haggis are Liverpool natives (the former from Woolton and the latter from Garston), while Tord is from the Norwegian city of Elverum. Over the course of 2004 to 2005, the band released many EPs such as <i>The Hangover Sessions</i>, <i>No.3</i>, and <i>The Daring Adventures of Sgt. Wimbo and His Pet Otter</i>. Their first official release was <i>Lost in the Post</i>, which was issued as a limited edition vinyl on 10 July 2006 on the London-based indie label KIDS Records and came with a distinctive additional second sleeve in the form of a FedEx (“WomEx”) package. In 2006, the band’s first album, <i>Girls, Boys and Marsupials</i>, was released solely in Japan.</p><p>In January 2007, the band released a second limited edition vinyl on KIDS called <i>Moving to New York</i> (again featuring a second sleeve, this time in the style of a suitcase), then in May that year they released a third single on KIDS entitled “Backfire at the Disco”, which reached No. 35 on the UK Singles Chart. This was followed by the band’s first full single after signing to 14th Floor Records, “Kill the Director”, in late July. Their debut album, <i>A Guide to Love, Loss & Desperation</i>, coincided with the release of “Let’s Dance to Joy Division” (widely regarded as the band’s signature song) in October 2007 and peaked at No. 11 on the UK Albums Chart. It was followed by a European tour ending with a Thanksgiving party at Liverpool Academy.</p><p>The band started 2008 as the opening act at the opening ceremony of Liverpool’s European Capital of Culture celebrations at Liverpool Arena.
