She told viewers that she is “not on the market anymore” after she <a href=#>started seeing a doctor</a>, who is divorced and has children in their 20s, after her split from husband <strong>Kevin Hunter</strong>. She also announced that she was <a href=#>diagnosed with lymphedema</a>, a condition that has caused swelling in her legs.</p><p>With everything going on in her life, Williams has been very busy. “She’s having fun connecting with old friends and making new ones in New York City,” the source tells Us. “She found a whole new life for herself.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After the Emmy nominee <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Hunter, 46, in April ahead of their 21st wedding anniversary, he was <a href=#>ousted as an executive producer</a> on her syndicated talk show. A <a href=#>recent report claimed</a> that there has been “chaos” on set without Hunter there, which a source close to the show calls “absolutely false.”</p><p>“The staff’s morale is at an all-time high the past few months and everyone supports Wendy and her ‘new life’ wholeheartedly,” the show source tells Us. “Producers having access to their host is normal protocol on any show. The staff can’t wait to return for an unprecedented 11th season in September.”</p><p>The Ask Wendy author, who previously <a href=#>struggled with alcohol abuse</a> and <a href=#>cocaine addiction</a>, had another turn of good news this summer. Earlier this week, her 18-year-old son Kevin Hunter Jr.’s <a href=#>assault case was dismissed</a> after Kevin Sr. declined to pursue charges in the wake of their <a href=#>headline-making physical altercation</a> in May.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnZ6Zxm7DyKWjopmdqHqqv4yfnJ6kmaO0br%2FTq6ann5WnerW0wKdknq6Vp3qistOeqWarpaK6pr6MoaCarKWofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
