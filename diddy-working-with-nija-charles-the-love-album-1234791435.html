The project boasts guest appearances from veterans like The-Dream, <a href=#>Mary J. Blige</a>, Babyface, and John Legend, but also makes sure to usher in the latest class of R&B stars.&nbsp;One collaboration in particular wound up making a lasting impression.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The alley-oop moment for me was a young woman by the name of Nija,” the music executive tells VIBE. “I had her write me a record, ‘cause she’s actually one of the top writers in the game. She writes hits for everybody, but she wants to be an artist herself. When she was communicating with A&R, they told her, ‘Yeah, Diddy wants you to be on the album.’”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“And they didn’t take her artistry seriously, and she came to me and was like, ‘Nah, that record is for me as an artist. I’m not giving that away.’ And I felt that thing where somebody is like, ‘Nah, it’s my time.’” Nija can be heard showing off her vocals on the new LP with her track “Stay Awhile.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=#>The Bad Boy founder</a> then compared the 25-year-old’s talent to his own drive, saying, “And I came from that. I came in the game because I was dancing my pain away because I thought I was going to be a football player, but God intervened and someone put me in their music video. Me recognizing that hunger and also how the purpose of this album is to be able to be a platform for people, I go from being on stage to being the stage.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Hailing from New Jersey, Nija Charles is an GRAMMY-nominated singer-songwriter who continues to move the needle with her pen and voice. She has written some of pop’s top hits in the last few years, including tracks like “Positions” by Ariana Grande, “No Guidance” by <a href=#>Chris Brown</a>, and “Rain On Me” by Lady Gaga, and plenty more. She released her 10-track solo project, Don’t Say I Didn’t Warn You, in January 2022.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“From Jozzy, to Nija, to Kalan.FrFr, to <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234744072>Coco Jones</a> — who didn’t even have a single out when we did the record with her — is me recognizing talent and empowering them. Those are the alley oops,” he concludes.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Revisit The Love Album: Off the Grid down below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m2pbDYZq6oqpueu6h51qKroWWenreiecKhmKuklah6tbTEZqOorpVirq2u1KZkampjaYR6fZNsbGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
