It’s common for some older people to want to look and feel younger as well. They want to feel that same excitement and thrill they did in their youth. Celebrities are no different; some older celebs have been criticized for not dressing their age. At the same time, some younger celebs can hear the same thing. It’s difficult sometimes for the public to watch an innocent, young pop sensation transform into a risqué and provocative sex symbol right in front of their eyes. Many young celebrities will go through an evolution through their career. For example, <a href=#>Christina Aguilera</a> began her career with a teen idol bubblegum image. She then caused a massive amount of controversy when she began to dress sexier and more provocatively. She has now evolved into a more mature image (which some say resembles movie stars like <a href=#>Marilyn Monroe</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For some it might just be a journey they’re on and for others it’s an expression of freedom.
