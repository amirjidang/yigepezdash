The former couple welcomed three children together — Rafferty, 23, Iris, 19, and Rudy, 17 — before calling it quits in October 2003.</p><p>Law and <a href=#><strong>Sienna Miller</strong></a> met while filming Alfie in 2003 and got engaged the following year. They broke things off after the England native had an affair with his kids’ nanny, but then rekindled their romance in 2009. The exes officially <a href=#>ended their relationship in 2011</a>.</p><p>Between their first breakup and reunion, the Golden Globe nominee went on to welcome Sophia, now 10, with<strong> Samantha Burke</strong>. He and <strong>Catherine Harding</strong>’s daughter, Ada, now 5, was born in 2015.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Fantastic Beasts star’s <a href=#>status has no effect on his home life</a>, he told Us Weekly in December 2018, explaining, “I don’t have that paranoia there. I think the thing I loath [about fame] is that you subconsciously are aware of, say, how you look or how you act, even when you know you’re not in the public eye. There’s a sense of, you may just put on a bobble hat, a woody hat and a coat over your pajamas.”</p><p>The Tony nominee went on to tell Us at the time: “You go around the corner to get your milk from the shops, and while 90 percent of you is going, ‘Oh yeah, it’s Sunday morning, I’m getting my milk,’ there’s always 10 percent going, ‘Oh, bloody hell, I forgot I’ve gone out in my pajamas. Maybe someone’s going to take my photo.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGajrZSaeq2t1manoaGcobaxrYycppqmXayyra%2FOppxmaaOpeqS0yKWbZqyfnLK1tMSrZKGho2KDtbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
