In fact, she was the youngest cast member, even if viewers couldn't tell by watching her act.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">grown up a lot over the years</a>, but Sasha's always been supremely mature, which is how she landed her role on 'PLL' with no trouble at all.&nbsp;She was originally in the running to play Hanna, noted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CheatSheet</a>, but when the truth came out about her age, they changed their minds.</p><p>As for why Sasha lied in the first place, there's a simple answer for that.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pretty Little Liars: Ages, Heights and Relationship Statuses Of The Cast</a></span></p><p>Hollywood wouldn't have wanted to cast a 12-year-old in a role meant for someone in their early 20s. After all, most "teens" in film are way older than they look.</p><p>Sasha Pieterse impressed producers with her acting chops, of course, and they were considering her for the role of Hanna. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmopolitan</a>&nbsp;even highlighted a rumor that said Sasha didn't reveal her true age until&nbsp;after she'd filmed the pilot of 'PLL.' If that's true, it's "very Alison of her," says the publication.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless, Pieterse's acting was what earned her a job, but she couldn't tackle the full-time role of Hanna for two reasons: one, producers were uncomfortable with her doing typical teen stuff at the tender age of 12. Two: they couldn't have her work many hours since she was under 16.</p><p>Although,&nbsp;Sasha&nbsp;did graduate at the age of 14, so it wasn't like she was still in high school during every season. Plus, she had a few roles before her big debut on 'PLL,' so it sort of seems like producers should have realized her age from the get-go. She'd already starred in a project alongside Buffy, after all (in 2007's 'The Air I Breathe')!</p><p>Though Pieterse did turn 13 early on in the show's timeline, she was still the baby of the cast, even if she didn't act that way. And she cherished her time on the show as well as the opportunity to add more depth to her character throughout the seasons. Though at first, she worried about how fans would perceive the character, noted&nbsp;CheatSheet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She needn't have worried; audiences loved her interpretation of Alison, and she became a fan favorite.</p><p>She's since said goodbye to her character, at least partly. Sasha Pieterse is a mama now, and she's now at the ripe old age of&nbsp;24 if fans can believe it.</p><p>The real question is, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will Sasha and the rest of the cast appear on the reboot of 'Pretty Little Liars'</a>? Fans have their fingers crossed, but for now, it's a waiting game.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Which 'Pretty Little Liars' Star Has The Highest Net Worth?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGinq52kqcZuuMitq6WdXaG2or7SZq6hsV2orrS0wGanop2kmr%2B0sYyloJ6cXZavsMHTZp%2Beql2WtKZ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
