Read on to find out more about Julianne Phillips, Bruce Springsteen’s ex-wife; from her biography down to her marital life and other important facts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=julianne-phillips-bio></span><strong>Julianne Phillips’ Bio</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julianne Phillips was born on 6th May 1960 in Evanston, Illinois, United States. She, however, grew up in Lake Oswego, Oregon where she attended the Lake Oswego High School. While her father, William Phillips worked as an insurance agent, her mother, Ann was a housewife.</p><p>Julianne Phillips attended Brook’s College in Long Beach, California. On completing her college education in the early 1980s, she moved to Manhattan, New York City where she pursued modeling. She soon landed a job with the Elite Modeling Agency, earning a mouthwatering pay of about $2,000 per day.</p><p>Julianne later left New York for Los Angeles where she gradually started acting by first featuring in a music video by the rock band .38 Special. In 1984, she landed her first television movie role in Summer Fantasy. Later in the same year, she starred in yet another television movie, His Mistress. She also appeared in the end of her would-be husband’s music video, “Glory days” (1984).</p><p>Despite the heckles of Julianne Phillip’s marital life, she soared in her acting career. In 1986, she portrayed the character of Sally in the comedy film, <i>Odd Jobs. </i>1988 saw her appear in two films – <i>Sweet Lies</i> and <i>Seven Hours to Judgment </i>where she starred as Dixie and Lisa Eden respectively. In 1989, she landed roles in&nbsp;<i>Fletch Lives</i> and&nbsp;<i>Skin Deep</i>. Other roles followed in television films including Getting Up and Going Home (1992), A Vow to Kill (1995) and Original Sins (1995).</p><p>In May 1991, Julianne started playing her breakthrough role in the NBC drama series, Sisters which aired till May 1996. Julianne’s role as Frankie in the series saw her climb to immense prominence. After this, she starred in numerous other movies including <i>Big Bully</i>&nbsp;(1996),&nbsp;<i>Colin Fitz Lives!</i>&nbsp;(1997),&nbsp;<i>Allie & Me</i> (1997), and <i>Tidal Wave: No Escape</i>&nbsp;(1997).</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=family-life></span><strong>Family Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Julianne Phillips met Bruce Springsteen, a popular American musician who was at the prime of his career in 1984. After a few months of dating, the pair tied the knot. The wedding which took place on 13th May 1985 was highly covered by the media. However, the union did not last. Julianne filed for a divorce just a little over three years into the marriage, precisely on 30th August 1988, citing irreconcilable differences. The proceedings were concluded in March 1989 and they had no child together.</p><p>Prior to their divorce, Bruce Springsteen had already started dating his bandmate, Patti Scialfa, an American singer, and songwriter. He moved in with her in 1987 and proceeded to marry her in 1991. The couple had three kids and remained together until Springsteen died in 2002.</p><p>Coming down to her biological family, Julianne Philips is the last among the six children of her parents (four boys and two girls). Her parents, Ann and William Phillips were both devoted Catholics and raised her alongside her siblings in the faith. This is probably the reason they were not quite comfortable with Julianne being a model. Hence, her father encouraged her to take up acting instead.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-about-bruce-springsteens-ex-wife></span><strong>Facts About Bruce Springsteen’s Ex-Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-julianne-phillips-was-11-years-younger-than-bruce-springsteen></span> <strong>1.

While Julianne was 25 at the time of their marriage, Bruce was 36. But unlike many others which turned out successful, theirs did not just work. Bruce’s subsequent marriage to someone who is closer to his age points at the possibility of their age difference playing a role in the termination of their marriage.
