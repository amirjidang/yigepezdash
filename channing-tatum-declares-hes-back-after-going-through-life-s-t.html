Injuries, life s–t, and just insanity in general. Ha daddy is finally back boooi!! Gonna be a fun next 10 year run,” the Step Up actor, 40, captioned a black-and-white snapshot via Instagram on Thursday, September 24. “To all those that have been there for me and held me down through it all. I love you. I’m gonna make ya proud. Let’s goo [sic]. Also peep the purell bottle. Keep it clean out there folks. Hahaha.”</p><p>The Magic Mike star <a href=#>posed for the mirror selfie</a> in a trailer, putting his chiseled six-pack on full display. Three days earlier, Tatum reflected on his time <a href=#>preparing for his upcoming film Dog</a> with longtime pal<strong> Reid Carolin</strong>. The road trip comedy marks Tatum’s directorial debut.</p><p>“It’s already been a crazy ride. And we’ve only just begun. And if we survive the rest, it will be one of the most insane stories that I’ve ever been a part of. And I’ve been a part of some pretty crazy ones in this life of mine,” the Alabama native wrote alongside a picture of himself perched on the hood of a blue car. “This photo is from our first day of production on the first movie that my partner Reid and I are directing. This is our story. It’s taken us two years to get it to the starting line. The next eight weeks will be like riding a bull on sickmode in ludicrous speed. God be with us. In Dog we trust. #DogMovie @dogthefilm.”</p><p>Tatum’s creative endeavors come in the wake of his <a href=#>split from<strong> Jessie J</strong></a>. Us Weekly confirmed in October 2018 that the pair began quietly dating months prior. The Dear John actor and the “Bang Bang” songstress, 32, <a href=#>called it quits in December 2019</a> but reconciled just a few weeks later. In April, they pulled the plug on their romance once more.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Channing-Tatum-Shares-Ripped-Shirtless-Selfie-and-Declares-He-Is-Back.jpg><p>Before dating the former The Voice UK coach, Tatum was married to Step Up costar <a href=#><strong>Jenna Dewan</strong> </a>from 2009 to 2018. The Flirty Dancing host, 39, filed for divorce six months after the pair announced their separation in April 2018. The exes share daughter Everly, 7, and <a href=#>became legally single</a> in November 2019. Their <a href=#>divorce was finalized</a> in February.</p><p><a href=#>Coparenting amid the coronavirus pandemic</a> has come with its challenges, but an insider told Us in May that “there’s no drama” between Tatum and Dewan, who <a href=#>welcomed son Callum</a> in March with fiancé <a href=#><strong>Steve Kazee</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacoJGju6q6xmarmqylonqlscKlmKudo2K1pr%2BMm5ico12Ws7Wx0WaeqKGenHq1tNGorKCgXaG2p7GMrGStZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
