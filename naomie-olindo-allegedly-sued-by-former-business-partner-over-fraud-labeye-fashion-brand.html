Southern Charm is an American reality television series that premiered on Bravo on March 3, 2014. The series chronicles the personal and professional lives of several socialites who reside in Charleston, South Carolina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cox alleged in her court filing, obtained by The Richest on Thursday, October 20, that the 30-year-old Southern Charm star had employed deceptive tactics to main control of L’Abeye, in which they had 50/50 ownership stakes and misappropriated earnings.</p><p>“At times, Olindo would mention to Plaintiff that their account funds were low and Plaintiff would question Olindo about the low funds because of the amount of revenue and profit that L’Abeye appeared to be making,” Cox’s court filing read, alleging she was unaware of their profit margins. “Subsequently, Olindo excluded Plaintiff from any information about the finances.”</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Logan Paul & KSI Call Off Feud, Become Business Partners</b></a></span></p><p>The former retail store manager and buyer — who filed the lawsuit in Charleston, S.C., on Sept. 19 — says the reality star approached her to come on board this joint venture as a co-owner with 50 percent stake in early 2018 because of her background in fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the onset of the apparel brand, Cox and Olindo traveled throughout Los Angeles to meet with vendors, worked together create a logo, a website and help promote the company.</p><p>Prior to the launch of the business in June 2018, Olindo secured a $50,000 loan from her father to provide startup capital, but Cox claims the Bravolebrity used this as reason to withhold profits from her moving forward, per <a href=#><i>Page Six.</i></a></p><p>According to Cox, Olindo also hired attorney Brian Collie at the firm Buxton & Collie and allegedly had him set up L’Abeye as a “sole member limited liability company,” in which “she was the sole member and owner.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Plaintiff had no knowledge of this false representation made to Collie,” the lawsuit states, adding that the failure to include Cox as member in the LLC “effectively and intentionally” deprived her of “her legitimate interests in the business.”</p><p>Cox claims she had spent hundred of hours helping to build the brand and that both of the women had agreed that they were co-owners. The Fashion Merchandising degree-holder also states, per the suit, that Olindo mentioned they were business partners in several podcasts and media interviews.</p><p>In the complaint, Cox also calls out how her work ethic was allegedly much stronger than Olindo’s.</p><p>“From the initial launch of the business in early 2018 until May 19, 2022, Plaintiff worked nearly every day to ensure the success of L’Abeye,” her attorneys argue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By comparison, the lawsuit adds that Olindo allegedly “took frequent vacations and failed to assist with the operations of L’Abeye for weeks at a time.”</p><p>Despite the fashion brand becoming “very successful and profitable” by generating “significant gross revenue and substantial profit,” Cox claims she was not paid the dues she was owed and the appropriate salary they allegedly agreed upon.</p><p>“Because Olindo was controlling the bank account, Plaintiff was unaware of the&nbsp;amount of funds that Olindo was misappropriating,” the lawsuit claims.</p><p>Cox also alleges, per her attorneys, that at times the TV star would “mention” to her that the “account funds were low,” which appeared to be disproportionate to the revenue and profit that was being made.</p><p>Following contentious conversations about the company’s accounting, Olindo allegedly “excluded” Cox “from any information about the finances.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Bubba Wallace Allegedly Been Suspend After Crash And Heated Altercation In Las Vegas</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS7orvMopxmp5yeu6W7jJqjpZ2XmrGtxYysrJ6cXZfGbrLOq6Seql2XwrS1zZ6qrGWglr%2B1usSrZKiulad6p77ArptmpJGXsrqxjJ%2BYrKCZpLturtGapZ1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
