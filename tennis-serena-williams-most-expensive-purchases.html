She's the best female tennis players of all time and is also the highest-earning female athlete in the world, Last year she pocketed <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$29,000,000</a>, and she has a total net worth evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$180,000,000</a>.&nbsp;Needless to say, those are some pretty impressive numbers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Things Serena Williams Does To Achieve Success</a></span></p><p>Serena is one of the most dedicated and focused players you can see at the tennis court, and she hates to lose. Perhaps that is the very combination that took her so far. But she also uses her fortune to have the lavish life she deserves when she is not competing.</p><h2 id=beverly-hills-mansion---6-700-000>Beverly Hills Mansion - $6,700,000</h2><p>Serena Williams bought this fantastic house in 2017 for an impressive <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6,700,000</a>. But it is worth the amount. The 6,000 square-foot Spanish-inspired mansion is located between the mountains in Beverly Hills, and she has neighbors like Britney Spears and Gwen Stefani. The tennis player bought it just one month after having her first daughter so that it might have a special meaning.</p><p>As with <a href=#>most insanely expensive upper class homes</a>, the place has an enormous dining room, terrace, swimming pool, wet bar, and a wine cellar. Besides that, the three floor property features five bedrooms and seven bathrooms. Serena chose the minimalist decor for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bel-air-home---6-610-000>Bel-Air Home - $6,610,000</h2><p>Back in 2006, Serena Williams bought a 2.76-acre property in Bel-Air for <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6,610,000</a>. This mansion that dates from 1935 has several rooms made with marble, a master suite, and a walk-in closet. Probably the most outstanding feature is a beauty salon, fully furnished. It sounds convenient when you have to attend as many events as Serena.</p><p>There isn't a tennis court, but Serena could enjoy other features like a swimming pool and a great terrace. The athlete sold the house this year for $8,100,000.</p><h2 id=fitness-guru>Fitness Guru</h2><p>Most of the celebrities spend thousands of dollars on personal trainers. However, when you are one of the best athletes in history, your demands are even higher. Williams hired <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mackie Shilstone</a>, that is defined as a career extension specialist, and they have been working together for 11 years now. In 2015, he developed a shoulder program for Serena, and she improved a lot her game.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shilstone works with names like Bernard Hopkins, Roy Jones Jr, Ozzie Smith, and Darryl Strawberry. He also became a social media star, since Serena often shares pictures of him.</p><h2 id=wedding---1-000-000>Wedding - $1,000,000</h2><p><a href=#>Weddings are expensive</a>, and Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian tied the knot in 2017 in one of the most lavish ceremonies of the year. Both are wealthy and can afford the wedding of their dreams. The ceremony was held at the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center, and the romantic day cost the couple <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$1,000,000</a>, according to the Mirror.</p><p>The couple shared adorable pictures of the day and shared lovely words. Some of the most beautiful pictures are with the couple's daughter, who was just a few months old. But this wedding ceremony was not the most expensive thing of the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wedding-dresses---3-500-000>Wedding Dresses - $3,500,000</h2><p>Serena Williams wore three gorgeous dresses on her wedding day. She flew to London multiple times to meet Sarah Burton, creative director of Alexander McQueen, and she fell in love with the princess-like dress, something Williams thought she would never do. Several sources affirm that the gown and jewelry she wore were evaluated at <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$3,500,000</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>The 10 Most Expensive Weddings Of All Time</a></span></p><p>The tennis star wore a second dress designed by Versace. Donatella Versace said that her staff worked <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">1,500 hours on it</a>. For their first dance as husband and wife, Williams wore another Versace dress.</p><h2 id=honeymoon>Honeymoon</h2><p>Serena and Ohanian's fairy-tale moments didn't end at their wedding. After tying the knot, they went to a private island in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Bahamas</a>. The couple picked up a four-bedroom villa with an immense terrace. Outdoors there is a swimming pool with a view of the ocean. To reach the reclusive island, people need a private ferry, a helicopter, or seaplane.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is the perfect place for celebrities looking for peace on their holidays. Surprisingly, this is a luxury that few people can afford, and it costs $35,000 per week. It was a fantastic way to start their married life.</p><h2 id=renting-private-jets>Renting Private Jets</h2><p>Serena Williams seems to be always traveling for holidays, for tennis tournaments around the world, or just to try her wedding dress in London. Of course, she has enough money to skip the long check-in lines most of us have to deal with at the airport. Although Williams doesn't have a private plane, she is often seen traveling around on rented ones.</p><p><a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Williams</a> shared a picture of when she traveled on a private jet with her daughter for the first time and said she was a little scared. However, Olympia seems to have no problems with flights, and her mother confessed the little girl has too much energy and run at the <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plane aisle</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=personal-chef>Personal Chef</h2><p>Having a personal chef is another luxury that is common among A-list celebrities. But for Serena, her diet is also part of her preparation for tournaments. She hired the chef Lauren Von Der Pool, who is a raw food enthusiast, to prepare her meal. Pool also recommends tees, green juice, meditation, and ingredients like cayenne pepper. After Serena, she worked with Novak Djokovic, another tennis star.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp; <a href=#>10 Rules Celebrity Chefs Followed to Become Successful</a></span></p><p>In 2017, she hired the chef <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric Grutka,</a> who ran a famous restaurant called Ian's Tropical Grill. Grutka follows Serena around the world, which sounds like a busy but fun job.</p><h2 id=charity>Charity</h2><p>Serena Williams is also worried about giving it back to society. Last year Williams donated $10,000 to <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Colin Kaepernick's</a> project to help homeless people. The athlete also supports UNICEF, Elton John AIDS Foundation, and The HollyRod Foundation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Williams also has the Serena Williams Foundation, which aims to promote equity through education and also helping victims of senseless violence. The Foundation is not limited to the US, which makes it even nobler. This year the project helped to build schools in <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenya</a>, and in the past, they also supported projects in Jamaica.</p><h2 id=personal-stylist>Personal Stylist</h2><p>Serena Williams is not only one of the best athletes of all time, but she is also a fashion icon. She has a lot of personality, and she changed the definition of style on the tennis court forever. This is an athlete that always shows up on competition wearing stylish jumpsuits or skirts.&nbsp;In fact, she has&nbsp;a partnership with Nike.</p><p>Williams keeps the style outside the court with the help of <a class=_e75a791d-denali-editor-page-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kesha McLeod</a>, who worked as her personal stylist for many years. Some of her best fashion was on display when she was pregnant. McLeod revealed that the clothes aimed to highlight her baby bump.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp; <a href=#>The 10 Richest Athletes Of 2019</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmislaO7qr%2BMrJyrnZ6Weri1y6WgmqWjYrqwv9NmnLGolaPAqsLEZqeuqpOdrrSx0mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
