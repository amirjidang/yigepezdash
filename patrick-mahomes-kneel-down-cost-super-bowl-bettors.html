The defense held on from there, and the Chiefs escaped with a 31-20 victory.</p><p>Those who bet on Mahomes and the Chiefs shouldn't have much to complain about. After all, all hope looked lost for Kansas City until Mahomes and the offense kick-started the comeback.</p><p>Well, actually, Mahomes cost bettors aplenty on Kansas City's final drive.</p><p>One prop bet allowed bettors to guess the over/under for Mahomes' total rushing yards. Per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN's David Purdum</a>,&nbsp;the under started at 27.5, and it moved "up to as high 36.5." And the 24-year-old quarterback, per Purdum, was at 44 yards on the ground during Kansas City's final drive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Mahomes proceeded to kneel down on three straight plays -- for losses of five, three and seven yards. Mahomes then threw the ball downfield on the final play to drain the clock. That left Mahomes with 29 official rushing yards on the night, so those who bet the over lost out big time.</p><p><strong>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Patrick Mahomes Surpasses Tom Brady As NFL Player Merchandise Sales Leader</a></strong></p><p>Caesars Sportsbook director of trading Jeff Davis said that the Mahomes' over/under rushing yards were "close to a six-figure swing (in favor of the house)," per Purdum.</p><p>For most of the game,&nbsp;Mahomes and the Kansas City offense faced resilient pressure and tight coverage from the 49ers. The 2018 MVP was sacked four times and picked off twice. But like he did in&nbsp;the Chiefs' previous two playoff games, Mahomes found a way to bring his team back from a double-digit deficit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mahomes finished the game with 26 completions on 42 attempts for 286 yards and two touchdowns. He and Hall of Fame running back Emmitt Smith are the only two players to win an MVP award plus a Super Bowl before age 25.</p><p><strong>Next: <a href=#>Release Date Revealed For Westworld Season 3 Along With New Trailer</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6toqJGpv6qvymakmqCforK0ecqnnJ6kXZm8uLqMnKasrF2owrGx0WaZqK%2BcYq%2BmwNOoqaxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
