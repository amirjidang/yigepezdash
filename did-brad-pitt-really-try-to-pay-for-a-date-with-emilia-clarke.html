However, early on, this wasn't the reality. <a href=#>Clarke revealed that she struggled to get certain gigs because of her looks</a>. The actress grew frustrated over the constant rejections, however this in turn sparked a fire for her to work even harder.</p><p>“It got me angry,” she said. “Well, no, not angry. ‘Angry’ is the wrong word. But it pushed me into another casting type; forced me to be an actor. Instead of playing Juliet and doing the light, airy stuff, I would be the granny who cracks wise, or a down-and-out hooker who has seen better days.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Brad Pitt Saw An Executive Walk Out During His Film, Here's How He Reacted</a></span></p><p>We don't often hear about the struggles, though clearly, Clarke went through a few before her fame. Nowadays, she can look back on those moments with pride, given her rising popularity. Not only that, but she called a certain moment the best of her life when a major star attempted to win a date with her. Let's take a look at how it all went down.</p><h2 id=brad-pitt-put-in-a-huge-bid-for-a-date-with-emilia-clarke>Brad Pitt Put In A Huge Bid For A Date With Emilia Clarke</h2><p>Emilia Clarke had a massive smile on her face telling the story back. For a good cause at Sean Penn’s fundraiser for relief in Haiti, the actress took part in an experience which would involve the highest bidder getting a date with her. <a href=#>Clarke thought it was going to be a private auction sort of ordeal, but what wasn't the case.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I was at a gala event where I’d been asked to auction something,’ she explained in an interview with The Hollywood Reporter. ‘So I was like, “I don’t know, come watch your favorite Game of Thrones episode with me and we’ll eat a horse’s heart or something,”’ she recalled.</p><p>"I don’t think about what it is until I get there and then I’m sitting in a room with, like, every celebrity on the planet. And I thought it would be a private thing where they wouldn’t say [the item] out loud, but then I have to stand up and it turns into a thing."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Does Brad Pitt Try To Look Like The Women He Dates?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clarke was shocked at the bids flying in, and one included from the man himself, Brad Pitt. "The room goes completely silent and I’m going to die and then one of my friends puts his paddle up. Suddenly, some other people start to put their paddles up and one of those people was Brad Pitt."</p><p>Unfortunately for Clarke, Brad's bid to watch Game of Thrones with her fell short, as the leading bidder came in at $160,000. Nonetheless, it turned out to be a moment the actress won't ever forget.</p><h2 id=millions-of-viewers-watched-when-emilia-clarke-retold-the-story-on-the-graham-norton-show>Millions Of Viewers Watched When Emilia Clarke Retold The Story On The Graham Norton Show</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clarke retold the story on The Graham Norton Show. The video was a massive hit, generating over 20 million views on YouTube, making it one of the most watched Graham Norton Show videos ever. That's quite the accomplishment given all the great moments that have taken place on the show.</p><p>Fans in the comments had a blast with the moment, praising Clarke for her reaction.</p><p>"She is such a bubbly person. Nothing like the characters she plays. You got to love her. I've never seen one person with so many Eyebrow Expressions in my life."</p><p>"Can we just recognize how down to earth and humble Emilia is, who is genuinely surprised that Brad Pitt could show any interest in her. She has absolutely no idea how stunning and lovely, and she is."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quite the moment and one fans are still watching back.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>Twitter Users Want Emilia Clarke To Join Henry Cavill In New Rom-Com Movie</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdl7%2BisIypoK2sXaeyorjLsmStqqliwbB5z5qwZp6fp3qiecOaq55lp57BqXnEpqCloZFisK2t0aScaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
