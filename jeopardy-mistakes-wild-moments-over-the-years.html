During his original run in 2004, one of his most memorable mistakes happened when he was answering a question in the “Tool Time” category.</p><p>“This term for a long-handled gardening tool can also mean an immoral pleasure seeker,” read late host <a href=#>Alex Trebek</a>. Jennings, who had a commanding lead at the time, rang in with the response, “What’s a hoe?” As the audience began to laugh, Trebek quipped, “Whoa, whoa, whoa! They teach you that in school in Utah, huh?” (The Chase cohost graduated from the state’s Brigham Young University.)</p><p>The Planet Funny author later found himself at the center of a Jeopardy! controversy when some of his old tweets resurfaced just before he began his first stint as a guest host for the show <a href=#>following Trebek’s November 2020 death</a>. “Nothing sadder than a hot person in a wheelchair,” read one tweet Jennings posted in 2014.</p><p>The former software engineer <a href=#>apologized for the posts</a>, saying that they “worked as jokes” in his mind but didn’t read so well on screen. “Sometimes I said dumb things in a dumb way and I want to apologize to people who were (rightfully!) offended,” he tweeted in December 2020. “It wasn’t my intention to hurt anyone, but that doesn’t matter; I screwed up, and I’m truly sorry.”</p><p>Jeopardy! proceeded with Jennings’ gig as a guest host, but the Wall Street Journal later reported that the tweets may have cost him a job as Trebek’s permanent replacement. In August 2021, <a href=#>Sony Pictures announced that executive producer</a> <a href=#><strong>Mike Richards</strong></a> would take over as the syndicated game show’s permanent host, but <a href=#>Richards resigned days later</a> after multiple of his own controversies.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>After Richards’ departure, <a href=#><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a>, who had been announced as the host for primetime and spin-off specials, began filling in as the show’s interim host. The <a href=#>Big Bang Theory</a> alum has since alternated with Jennings, who is still a consulting producer on the show. In July 2022, Variety reported that the dynamic duo will <a href=#>continue sharing hosting duties</a>.</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look back at some of the wildest and most controversial moments in Jeopardy! history.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BfsrC8wKubsmWdnsC1rcqeqmavmaGxbrnOppynrKNivLex0WaroZ1drrKivtJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
