The two were married from 2002 up until 2008. Following the court settlement, McCartney was forced to fork over $48 million. As for Heather Mills, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she lashed out</a> over the treatment she faced behind the scenes during their separation. Mills told Daily Mail things got so bad, that she actually feared for her own life.</p><p>"It's been really, really stressful.

I absolutely did consider suicide about a year ago.
