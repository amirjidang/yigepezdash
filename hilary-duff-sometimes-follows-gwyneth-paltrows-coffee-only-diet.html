And in the morning, I’ll have some things that won’t spike my blood sugar. So, I have coffee,” Paltrow revealed on <strong>Dr. Will Cole</strong>’s&nbsp;<a href=#>“The Art of Being Well”</a>&nbsp;podcast at the time.&nbsp;“But I really like soup for lunch. I have bone broth for lunch a lot the days [sic]. … And then, for dinner,&nbsp;I try to eat, you know,&nbsp;according to Paleo. So, <a href=#>lots of vegetables.</a> It’s really important for me to support my detox.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>Iron Man&nbsp;</i>actress was <a href=#>quickly criticized for&nbsp;appearing to promote&nbsp;a meal plan</a> that echoes disordered eating, but she clarified that <a href=#>the diet was doctor-approved</a> following her <a href=#>coronavirus</a> battle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Hilary-Duff-Sometimes-Follows-Gwyneth-Paltrow-Morning-Diet.jpg><p class=p1>“The way [my “long COVID” symptoms] manifest for me is very high levels of inflammation over time,” Paltrow&nbsp;<a href=#>said&nbsp;during an Instagram Story Q&A on March 17</a>. “I’ve been working with Dr. Cole to really focus on foods that aren’t inflammatory, lots of vegetables, cooked vegetables, all kinds of protein, healthy carbs … and it’s been working really well.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “This is not to say that, you know, I eat this way all day, every day. And by the way, I eat far more than bone broth and vegetables. I eat full meals. I also&nbsp;have days where I eat whatever I want, French fries or whatever. But my baseline <a href=#>really has been to try to eat healthy</a>.”</p><p class=p1>Duff, for her part, explained on Tuesday’s podcast that she&nbsp;also eats and drinks more than just coffee.</p><p class=p1>“I <a href=#>wake up really hungry</a>. I’m obsessed with those cauliflower rounds. They’re so good. It’s made of cauliflower, but it looks like pita. … But they’re just cauliflower and, like, one other thing,” noted the&nbsp;<i>Material Girls&nbsp;</i>actress, who shares <a href=#>son Luca, 11,</a> with ex <a href=#><strong>Mike Comrie</strong></a> and <a href=#>daughters Banks, 4, and Mae, 2,</a> with husband <a href=#><strong>Matthew Koma</strong></a>. “They’re super clean and I put it in the air fryer, make it hard, make it crispy. Put, like, egg salad on top of it. I’ll do that or I’ll put, like, avocado or, like, a fried egg and a [Beyond Meat] vegan sausage. I’ll eat some avocado if I’m feeling [like I have] time to design the perfect little thing. I do overnight oats [too].”</p><p class=p1>She added: “I also eat a lot of things that are going in my kids’ lunches in the morning. So, lots of calories happen there! I was talking with my doctor and she was like, ‘What’s your morning like?’ [I said], ‘If we’re being honest, yeah, I eat a chicken nugget in the morning <a href=#>while I’m packing lunches</a> and there’s one leftover.’ Pop it down the hatch!”</p><p class=p1>Duff <a href=#>also prioritizes her fitness</a>, breaking down her regimen&nbsp;to Sims and her “Lipstick on the Rim” cohost, <strong>Emese Gormley</strong>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I <a href=#>do work out with a trainer</a> and we do, like, it’s something different every time,” the Texas native said. “He kind of tailors the workout for me. Sometimes it’s HIIT, sometimes it’s Tabata — I love a Tabata day. Tabata is, like, seven different workouts with a rest period in between but basically no stopping. It’s like [an] aggressive HIIT, and when there’s not a lot of time to work out, a Tabata is <a href=#>a great way to get a hard workout in fast.</a>”</p><p class=p1><i>If you or someone you know struggles with an eating disorder, visit the&nbsp;<a href=#>National Eating Disorders</a>&nbsp;(NEDA) website or call their hotline at (800) 931-2237 to get help.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqGhnJa%2FunnDrp2fZaOkuqbAyKacrGWWpLmtu9asZKCvqaOytbSMqZilrKKkxLR5wqidn52VYryvuNhmm6KdpGQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
