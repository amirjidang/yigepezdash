An electrician hailing from New Jersey took the life of his beautician wife and their two kids before shooting himself.&nbsp;</p><p>The authorities have not yet disclosed the names and ages of the slain people.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the victims, the couple’s son, initially survived the shooting that killed his mom and sister, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ABC7</a>.&nbsp; But the boy died hours later at University Hospital in Newark, Linden police said in a statement.</p><p>The authorities have not determined the reason behind Linden’s apparent slay-suicide.</p><p>The neighbors of the deceased <a href=#>family</a> are shocked and horrified. They find it extremely hard to believe that something so dreadful could happen in their society.</p><p><strong>“They were a normal family. That’s why it’s impossible to believe.”</strong> Angel Montanez, 56, told a source.</p><p>He further added that they used to go camping every long weekend with a trailer they hooked up to their car. The late family recently renovated their kitchen and invited me to show it.</p><p>Montanez said he’d regularly chat about work with the father because they’re both electricians. The families would often take one another’s kids to school.&nbsp;</p><p>This incident has led people to believe that what goes behind closed doors is as hidden as a buried star.&nbsp;</p><p>The family did everything that a typical family does. They walked their dog and went swimming just as often as the Montanez family.</p><p>Many people have questioned the father’s decision to kill his family before shooting himself. Some people have been empathizing with the father, while others consider his decision to be a display of poor judgment.</p><p>Another neighbor, 76-year-old Digna Alvarez, said she never heard any screaming noises coming from their home and described the father as kind and always willing to lend a hand.&nbsp;</p><p>Alvarez told ABC that she was home with her sister-in-law when her relative heard a child screaming.</p><p><strong>“She heard somebody screaming, but she ignored it, thinking that someone must be playing with the dog, and then no more,”</strong> she said.</p><p>An air of terror has prevailed in the neighborhood since this tragic incident occurred, but the authorities have made it clear that there is no threat to anyone residing there.&nbsp;</p><p>Neighbors said the father worked as an electrician, while his wife was a beautician who ran a salon out of their home.</p><p>Law enforcement agencies and the neighbors of the slain family are still trying to make sense of it all.&nbsp;</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC51KubnqpdqMKqr8idnGakmaOxprqMp6FmnpGitq3FjKacppqVp8Bw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
