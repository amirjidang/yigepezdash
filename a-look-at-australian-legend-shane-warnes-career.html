Hailing from a suburb in Melbourne, Australia, Warne became a professional cricketer in his early 20s after playing the Under 19 tournaments. A <a href=#>bowler who knew how to play</a> with the bat, he breathed life into the leg-spinning bowling style that was slowly dying in the world of cricket. He proved himself to be an influential cricketer in all cricket formats and played for various clubs during his active career. The player <a href=#>has managed to inspire</a> a whole generation of bowlers to use improved techniques in leg-spinning to catch maximum wickets.</p><p>While the Spin King of cricket got taken away soon, his legacy remains strong and impactful in the history of cricket. A record-breaking leg-spinner and a resilient leader, let’s look at Shane Warne’s staggering cricket career.</p><h2 id=a-steady-beginning>A Steady Beginning</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Shane Warne made his debut in International Cricket in 1992, and similar to other spinners in the sport, he found it difficult to set the tone of his game. While the player lacked accuracy in his bowling, selectors could see immense potential in him. After playing for a few matches that year, he rose to instant prominence in 1993 when he bowled out Mike Gatting in 1993 with a delivery that bounced outside the leg stump before landing on the cricket bails, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CricBuzz</a>. His mind-boggling delivery is considered the ball of the century.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As an up-and-coming bowler for Australia, Warne knew he had to prove himself with steady statistics to remain a part of the team. In 1994, he got 12 wickets under his belt against South Africa in a test match and made himself an integral part of the Australian team. <a href=#>One of his most successful bowling figures</a> appeared in the same year when the bowler took eight wickets against England in the ODI format, which remains one of the best career innings. He became a successful player in ODI matches and bagged a whopping 12 wickets at the Wills Cricket Cup in 1996. While his career soared until 2003, the player failed a drug test before the ICC World Cup and was sentenced to a one-year ban for all cricket formats, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Remembering Mark Lanegan: These Are The Singer's Highest-Grossing Songs</a></span></p><h2 id=rise-to-glory>Rise To Glory</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the ban, the player waiting for a comeback, Shane Warne, returned to play for Australian soil after twelve months with a solid sense to re-establish his name and identity. He took 26 wickets during his series with Sri Lanka and made a record total of 96 wickets in 2005. He was on the most prominent career roll that seemed to be reaching new heights using accuracy and leg-break. Shane Warne made and broke several records during his career as he established himself as one of the top five cricket players of the century.</p><p>As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPNCricInfo</a>, along with having a record of bagging the most wickets in a single year with 96 wickets in 2005, in December 2006, he became the first player to take 700 wickets. He also has the record of handling the most consecutive four wickets in a match and has the most runs in his Test career without ever making a century, and gained the second spot for taking the highest number of 10-wicket hauls at Test matches.</p><h2 id=farewell-to-cricket-and-other-projects>Farewell To Cricket And Other Projects</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of Shane Warne’s career highlights occurred in 1999 when he helped his team win the ICC ODI World Cup, the biggest feat in the world of cricket. Warne continued actively playing for the Australian squad for 15 years until he announced his retirement in 2007. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky News</a>, he played for franchises in the T20 format after retiring. He played domestic cricket for Hampshire and Victoria and in 2008 signed with Rajasthan <a href=#>Royals at the Indian Premier League</a>. He led the team to victory that year and took hold of the title. Warne retired from playing in 2013 and became a mentor and coach for various franchise teams.</p><p>He became a cricket commentator and expert behind-the-scenes and offered in-depth knowledge about the field, players, and techniques for various tournaments. He also ventured into business and founded his gin company SevenZeroEight Gin. In 2020, Warne launched his fragrance line called SW23 and became a featured celebrity athlete on Fox News. He spent his idle time playing golf and spending time with his family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The passing away of Shane Warne came as a shock to the world on March 04, 2022.
