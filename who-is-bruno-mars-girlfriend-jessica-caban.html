But Bruno's leading lady, Jessica Caban, has her own cash to flaunt -- and she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">throughout her man's meteoric rise to fame</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And if fans need any evidence of Jessica's self-sufficiency, all they need to do is visit her Wikipedia page. Yes, the model and actress has her own entry, and she's more than just Bruno Mars' girlfriend.</p><p>The 38-year-old New Yorker&nbsp;does live with Bruno, reports <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Knot</a>, and has since 2012. But the adorable couple has been together since 2011 (the first year of their relationship was long-distance). And despite the fact that he hardly ever talks about Jessica publicly, Bruno is clearly smitten.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Why These Celebrities Don't Use Their Real Names</a></span></p><p>For one thing, Bruno doesn't often appear on Jessica's Instagram. But when he does, it's not as a superstar singer -- it's just as her loving boyfriend. Most often, Caban posts pics with Bruno that also feature her family. But she also frequently gets together with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mars and&nbsp;his family, including his five siblings.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's downright adorable, actually. But get this: the pair even shares a pup, a Rottweiler named Geronimo.&nbsp;That's not to say Jessica's totally oblivious to her man's fame, though, even if their life together is the picture of domestic and familial bliss.</p><p>Clearly, Caban reps for Mars, but that's not&nbsp;all she's about. She keeps busy with her fashion collaborations, which started all the way back in 2002 with a modeling gig for JLO, Jennifer Lopez's fashion line.</p><p>Caban also has her own swimwear line, aptly named J Marie Swim, and fans won't find a single pic of Bruno on that promotional page.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jessica clearly likes to keep business and pleasure separate -- and maybe that's the key to her long-term relationship with one of the planet's biggest musical superstars?</p><p>Of course, modeling brands like Versace and Gucci on her IG also puts Jessica squarely in the spotlight -- but&nbsp;only&nbsp;to her&nbsp;271K followers. That's no small number to scoff at, but it is interesting that Bruno has 22.6 million followers, and yet his girlfriend is able to fly somewhat under the radar with her own interests and business endeavors.</p><p>Both halves of this famous couple clearly stay busy, though.&nbsp;Besides modeling and her business ventures, Jessica's also been spotted on shows like 'Jane the Virgin' -- she played a character named Sonia for four episodes (and Bruno appeared as well, but to sing, of course).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And while it might seem strange that Bruno Mars' girlfriend is living a pretty normal life, fans are still totally jealous of the gorgeous model!</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bruno Mars Defends Himself Against Those Who Believe He Is Profiting Off Of Black Culture</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBurtGupahlnZa%2FtHnGoqmlnqKesq%2BwjKOcrKuZmK5ur8CbmKdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
