Kelly's conviction in 2021</a> to <a href=#>Bijou Phillips' response to Danny Masterson's prison term</a>. Then there are the people who become famous because of a particularly unique or dark case. When Gypsy Rose Blanchard was on trial in 2016 for the part she played in the murder of her mother Clauddine “Dee Dee” Blanchard, the world couldn't stop watching. People were even more shocked when they learned that <a href=#>Gypsy Rose found love while in prison</a> with Ryan Andersen.</p><p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard was released from prison in December 2023 and in April 2024, TMZ reported that <strong>Gypsy Rose Blanchard filed for divorce</strong>. This news made people reflect on the relationship... and it turns out that there are some perplexing details.

Gypsy said that she was afraid he was going to hit her. He didn't — but that happened in the past with her mother. So, her first instinct was to tighten up and be prepared.

However, unless she says so herself, that is just speculation. But based on what a source explained to In Touch Weekly, that might be true. The source said, “They both realized they’d made a mistake getting married. It was too much too soon.”</p><p>While people may never know the real reason why the couple split up, Entertainment Tonight reported on a scary detail of the divorce: <strong>Blanchard</strong><strong>filed a restraining order</strong><strong>against Andersen</strong> in April 2024. If her friend's allegations against Andersen are true, then she did that because she felt unsafe because of his behavior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiesqijrnqzu9KeZJukkaOwqa3RnWSrsZGjeqK6w56prKeeqHqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
