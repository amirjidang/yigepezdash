Most fans know that the pair had a troubled romance, though it did result in the birth of their daughter Lisa Marie, who appeared to be the light of Elvis' life (and the reason for much of his excessive spending).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Elvis Presley: Here Are 15 Things That Recently Came To Light</a></span></p><p>But over time, Priscilla and Elvis, though they seemed to remain friends, drifted apart romantically. And by the time Elvis passed away in 1977, he was engaged to someone else (and Priscilla had recently split from Robert Kardashian).</p><p>Who was Ginger Alden, Elvis' fiancee, and were the pair really going to get married before Presley's untimely passing?</p><h2 id=who-is-ginger-alden>Who Is Ginger Alden?</h2><p>Ginger Alden was a model and actress who was quite young when she and Elvis first crossed paths. Later, they would reconnect, then get engaged, with plans to be married in late 1977.</p><p>The story has some eerie parallels to Elvis' earlier relationship and marriage to Priscilla Presley, and fans already know that the musical superstar was troubled throughout his life, and Priscilla was always assumed to have known the most about the man behind the music.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yet Ginger claimed a bit different experience with Elvis, even though their relationship, from the outside in, appeared fraught with drama.</p><h2 id=how-old-was-ginger-alden-when-she-met-elvis>How Old Was Ginger Alden When She Met Elvis?</h2><p>The very first time Ginger Alden met Elvis, she was apparently only five years old. But later, the two would reconnect when Ginger was an adult, and their relationship apparently began when she was 20 and he was around 40.</p><p>Either way, it was family ties that helped Ginger cross paths with Elvis; her father knew him, which explained their earlier connection, and Ginger's sister (a pageant queen) was later invited to meet Elvis and invited Ginger along.</p><h2 id=does-ginger-alden-still-have-her-engagement-ring>Does Ginger Alden Still Have Her Engagement Ring?</h2><p>Elvis made headlines for the expensive ring he apparently bought for Ginger, which was said to have cost around $70K, depending on the source. And Ginger did keep the ring, sources confirm, because in 2009, she planned to auction it off to the highest bidder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But at the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sources reported</a> that the diamond ring was in good condition, except for two chipped diamonds. The bidding was expected to start at around $30K and was about 11.5 carats.</p><p>Some fans didn't necessarily believe that this was the ring Elvis proposed with, and some fans are actually skeptical that he proposed at all. After all, sources suggest that Elvis hadn't yet announced their engagement officially, though he did publicly step out with Ginger (and her family) at his concerts and at other times.</p><p>Fans speculated about Ginger's reasons for selling the ring, but the most common guess was that she simply needed the money and had plenty of other ways to remember her late fiance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-happened-to-ginger-alden>What Happened To Ginger Alden?</h2><p>Something else fans really want to know about Elvis' famous fiancee? If she is still alive today! It turns out she is, and she seems to have had a pretty full life. In 1991, she married Ronald Leyser, whom she was with until his passing in 2015. The couple also had a child together, a son named Hunter.</p><p>Given her later marriage, fans thought that Ginger hung onto Elvis' engagement ring and her 'memories' for more than just nostalgia. Most seem to agree that Ginger's motivation was, to some extent, publicity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, she later penned a book about her time with Elvis titled 'Elvis and Ginger: Elvis Presley's Fiancée and Last Love Finally Tells Her Story.' Ostensibly, the book earned her some amount of cash, because everyone knows there are still plenty of Elvis-obsesses fans out there today.</p><p>And after all the speculation surrounding Elvis' penchant for younger women, along with his apparent attachment issues after his mother's passing, Ginger's story was of interest to many followers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Lisa Marie, Elvis Presley's Daughter</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, though, not every story from Elvis' past partners adds up. Various accusations and stories have been shared over the years, and no one really knows the truth. Of course, since Ginger was the one person with Elvis right before he died, fans seem to think that she has the answers they seek. Even if Ginger Alden herself had very little understanding of the man she called her fiance.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-elvis-leave-any-of-his-money-to-ginger-alden>Did Elvis Leave Any Of His Money To Ginger Alden?</h2><p>It appears as if Elvis didn't leave much -- if anything -- to Ginger Alden. Fans of Ginger would probably say that it was because they hadn't officially been married yet<strong>. </strong>But others might argue it's because he wanted <a href=#>his daughter to inherit everything</a> he had.</p><p>And others still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">would say</a> that Elvis had no intention of ever marrying Ginger, and was in fact dating various other women at the same time. It's up to fans to determine what they believe, or don't.</p><p><span class=related-single>NEXT: <a href=#>An Inside Look At The Career of Elvis’ Granddaughter: Riley Keough</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBus8innp6qXZa5pbHNZpylrpmoerG%2BxKyjnrGjYrOqrc2cnJ5llJqutbSO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
