However, since this movie came out in 2012, you might be wondering where exactly the actors and actresses that brought this iconic novel to life are now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest YA Authors Of All Time, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>In case you've ever questioned who the richest members of this cast are, you no longer have to. Here are the 10 richest cast members from this flick, ranked by Net Worth (according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>).</p><h2 id=wes-bentley---3-million>Wes Bentley - $3 Million</h2><p>Wes Bentley has quite literally become iconic as Seneca Crane. Seriously, we can't get his face out of our head. Still, this heartthrob isn't only in this franchise.</p><p>Most recently, you'll probably recognize him from&nbsp;Mission: Impossible - Fallout, Interstellar,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Pete's Dragon.&nbsp;He has a pretty modest film roster, but he definitely deserves a spot on this list for being a pretty stellar secondary character in a lot of your favorite flicks. Oh yeah, he's also a recurring character on&nbsp;American Horror Story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=alexander-ludwig---3-million>Alexander Ludwig - $3 Million</h2><p>You'll remember this young and handsome man as Cato, the villain of the games. He's actually Canadian, and this was probably his breakout role. Still, he was also in&nbsp;Lone Survivor,&nbsp;where his character was a pretty significant supporting role.</p><p>Most recently though, he was in&nbsp;Midway&nbsp;and has a recurring role in&nbsp;Vikings&nbsp;as Bjorn Lothbrok. We probably have way more to see from this guy, and we're sure that net worth will be going up pretty soon.</p><h2 id=josh-hutcherson---20-million>Josh Hutcherson - $20 Million</h2><p>Whether you're Team Gale or Team Peeta, you have to admit that you're at least kind of love with Josh Hutcherson. Of course, he plays Peeta Mellark, the sweetest man that ends up being Katniss's partner to the end.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Woody Harrelson Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>Josh was a pretty prominent child actor, so this franchise was definitely not his first rodeo. He's definitely been in a few movies lately, but he's also taken a back seat when it comes to leading roles. Most of his net worth is definitely from pre-Hunger Games, and we know you've loved this young heartthrob from the very beginning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=stanley-tucci---25-million>Stanley Tucci - $25 Million</h2><p>Stanley Tucci is a pretty iconic actor, and we honestly can't think of anyone else who could've brought Caesar Flickerman to life as brilliantly as he did. While this man has a whopping 133 acting credits under his belt, we're actually surprised his net worth isn't higher.</p><p>Still, most recently he's actually dabbled in television, and he has A LOT of movies in production. You'll recognize him from&nbsp;Transformers: The Last Night, The Silence,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Beauty and the Beast. Of course, this man's career isn't over, and he's even an Oscar-nominated actor.</p><h2 id=liam-hemsworth---26-million>Liam Hemsworth - $26 Million</h2><p>We know there are a bunch of people out there that will never be over the fact that Katniss picked Peeta over Gale. Of course, the talented and handsome Liam Hemsworth played Gale Hawthorne. This is probably his biggest and most popular role to date, but we know he's done other things.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hunger Games: 5 Reasons Why It's The Definitive YA Franchise (& 5 Why It's Not)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before he was Gale, he was Will Blakelee from&nbsp;The Last Song,&nbsp;where you probably fell in love with him first. Since then, he's taken a back seat, but he was still recently in&nbsp;Independence&nbsp;Day: Resurgence&nbsp;and&nbsp;Isn't It Romantic.&nbsp;We love this humble and brilliant man, and he's got a couple of flicks in the works.</p><h2 id=lenny-kravitz---50-million>Lenny Kravitz - $50 Million</h2><p>Of course, most of this man's net worth and fame comes from music, not acting. This Grammy Award-winning singer is definitely an icon in the industry, and it's no secret most of his dough comes from that.</p><p>Still, we loved Kravitz as Cinna in The Hunger Games and he still has a few other acting credits. Of course, this man's main contributions to film are for soundtracks, and we're definitely not complaining about that. His daughter, <a href=#>ZoÃ« Kravitz</a>, has been taking Hollywood by storm, though, so you can watch out for her.</p><h2 id=elizabeth-banks---50-million>Elizabeth Banks - $50 Million</h2><p>This iconic role as Effie Trinket is definitely one of our favorites of this bombshell actress, but it certainly wasn't her first or last role. Banks' net worth is pretty impressive because she's been in quite a few blockbuster flicks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, she was in&nbsp;Brightburn, The Happytime Murders, Pitch Perfect 3,&nbsp;and played Bosley in the new&nbsp;Charlie's Angels.&nbsp;We absolutely love this hilarious, badass, and talented gal, and we definitely haven't heard the last from her.</p><h2 id=donald-sutherland---60-million>Donald Sutherland - $60 Million</h2><p>Donald Sutherland was the perfect villain as President Snow. This man has nearly 200 acting credits under his belt, and it's probably pretty obvious that this teen franchise wasn't his first flick.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Highest-Grossing Jennifer Lawrence Movies Of All Time</a></span></p><p>This iconic man is still acting to an immense degree, and we're surprised his net worth isn't higher. While his list is pretty endless, most recently he's been in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ad Astra</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;American Hangman.&nbsp;He's clearly played a ton of roles, but he'll always have a special place in our hearts as President Snow.</p><h2 id=woody-harrelson---65-million>Woody Harrelson - $65 Million</h2><p>Honestly, Woody Harrelson is probably one of the most timeless and iconic actors of our generation. Again, his role as Haymitch Abernathy was certainly not his first, but we think he was absolutely perfect for the role, and we'll always remember him as the drunken adviser with a heart of gold.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This brilliant actor also has 100 acting credits, with multiple&nbsp;Oscar nominations to show for it. Most recently, you can catch this versatile genius in&nbsp;Midway, Zombieland: Double Tap, The Highwaymen, Solo: A Star Wars Story,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.&nbsp;We love this man, and we hope he's never done acting.</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence---130-million>Jennifer Lawrence - $130 Million</h2><p>Of all the people in this list, <a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> was probably one of the most unheard-of actresses. She had some acting credits under her belt, but The Hunger Games&nbsp;was without a doubt her breakout role and was the first that really got her name known. Ironically, she's also blown everyone else out of the water with her net worth since then. We don't need to tell you that she's the brilliant gal who played Katniss Everdeen, and we know that deep down, she'll always be the girl with the bow and the braid.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, this gal is now an Oscar winner and has been in a ton of critically-acclaimed films. Most recently, we suggest&nbsp;Red Sparrow, Mother!, Passengers,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Joy.&nbsp;But honestly, all of her movies are phenomenal, and it's not surprising her net worth is stellar. We definitely haven't heard the last of Katniss Everdeen.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Every Cast Member Of The Crown's Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fqq%2FHnqqtZZiqu6ix0WaemqWVqHqkrdKtZKadnZeys7%2BMp5ytZaekv7W0jKuYp6OVmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
