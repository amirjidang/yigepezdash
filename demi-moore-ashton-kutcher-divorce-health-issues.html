Weeks later, the couple announced their impending divorce, and Kutcher packed out of their Los Angeles home.</p><span class=txt>Close</span><p>The highly-publicized divorce, coupled with swirling rumors of Kutcher's infidelity, wrought utter devastation in Moore’s life, sending her into a months-long self-destructive spiral.

I smoked a little spice, which is like man-made pot. It’s not like I went wild and overdosed.

I was floating out of my body into swirling colors, and it seemed like maybe this was my chance: I could leave the pain and shame of my life behind. The headaches and the heartbreak and the sense of failure—as a mother, a wife, and a woman—would just evaporate.”</p><p>In her memoir, Moore delves into the emotional toll the incident took on her family, particularly her daughter Rumer, who was also at the party.</p><p>“I scared Rumer so badly when she saw me there, semiconscious on the floor; she thought I might die in front of her.

I rarely left the house, except to let the dogs out,” she shared in her memoir. “That feeling of not being anchored by all of these people’s needs and my role as their nurturer was unbearable. Not a lot was going on in my career, and even if there had been, I was too sick to work.
