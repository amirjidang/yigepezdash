Known for her themes of tragic romance and glamor and references to the 1950’s and 1960’s Americana, Del Rey’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">music and writing are unique</a> in both the music and cinematic world.

Her expansive vocal range and emotional delivery have stunned audiences since her early days and with more confidence now more than ever, her true self can shine on stage like the star she is. Her stage name came about from a number of things. Lana was inspired by the actress Lana Turner, who was a film star in the 1940’s and 1950’s. Del Rey is partly from Ford Del Rey, a midsized car produced in Brazil. By combining the two, Del Rey would have her stage name that has stuck even into her stardom.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Things We Recently Learned About Lana Del Rey</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=early-years>Early Years</h2><p>Lana Del Rey is actually named Elizabeth Woolridge by birth.
