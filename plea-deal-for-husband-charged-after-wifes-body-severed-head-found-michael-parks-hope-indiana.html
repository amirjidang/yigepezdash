Police searched the property and found dried blood in the driveway, garage, rear deck and backyard. A search warrant led to the discovery of Hope's head buried in the cellar.</p><p>On Friday, May 6, Parks was sentenced to 50 years in prison for the murder.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NOTE: The above video is from a previous report at the time of Parks' arrest.&nbsp;</strong></p><img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/e045c196-af37-4113-9935-e7cfb6d93f09/e045c196-af37-4113-9935-e7cfb6d93f09_16x9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/e045c196-af37-4113-9935-e7cfb6d93f09/e045c196-af37-4113-9935-e7cfb6d93f09_1140x641.jpg alt onload="this.style.opacity=1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Seth Hubble lived just a few houses away on Elm Street. He shot video of police taking Michael's truck away as evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"I live here with my wife, and we have three kids," Hubble said at the time. "It's hard. What do you tell them? They wonder, you know, they're young. So, how do you comfort your kids from, you know, telling them that there's a murder right down the street?"</p><p>Court records say Hope was killed by a gunshot to the back of the head. Police recovered a .22 caliber rifle from the house and a matching spent cartridge casing from the yard.</p><p>Digging deeper in the cellar uncovered plastic bags containing blood-covered rags.</p><img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/7d862a5a-79ab-4f67-8f18-c8cf2f46c813/7d862a5a-79ab-4f67-8f18-c8cf2f46c813_16x9.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> <img loading=eager src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.tegna-media.com/assets/WTHR/images/7d862a5a-79ab-4f67-8f18-c8cf2f46c813/7d862a5a-79ab-4f67-8f18-c8cf2f46c813_1140x641.png alt onload="this.style.opacity=1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p>Police also recovered a mobile phone belonging to Hope from a safe in the house.&nbsp;</p><p>Michael did not have a serious criminal history in Indiana prior to his wife's death.&nbsp;</p><p>His change of plea hearing is set for May 6.
