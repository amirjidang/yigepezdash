All the same, this is a reputation that contrasts sharply with the respect and admiration he receives from his colleagues. Emily Browning, Hardy's co-star in Legend, for instance, spoke highly of him during a promotion with Flicks and the City.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"[Tom] was a big draw for me because I was such a big fan of his for a long time," Browning commented. "He really, really cares about what he's doing. And he never phones it in. And he just wants the work to be really good. It's so nice to be around that energy when you're making a film because it makes you up your game."</p><p>Similarly, Cillian Murphy, who worked with Hardy on Peaky Blinders, lauded him not only for his exceptional acting skills but also for his friendship. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardy himself finds the label of being difficult a source of frustration</a>: "My intention is to help, which is frustrating, and I suppose maybe that’s why some people might find me difficult," Hardy said in an interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYrquknrturtSto56qXay8s7fIp55mr5mptW7AzqZkoZmimcZuu81mq6GdXZe2rLHRopueqqNixKK%2FjKinqaejnsGmec6fZLCgkal6qbGMnq%2BpnZOpsqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
