But some women, like Jennifer Jason Leigh, defy statistics and choose to have children much later in life. For this actress, it was only once she reached her late forties that she gave birth, and her journey into motherhood has been beautiful and fascinating. In some ways, late motherhood was a better choice for her, and her comments on the joy her son has brought her makes it clear that she is enjoying and fully appreciating every moment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But why did she wait so long to have a child? And did it impact her career, as it does to so many Hollywood actresses? Let us explore how Jennifer Jason Leigh's life has changed...</p><h2 id=why-did-jennifer-jason-leigh-wait-to-have-a-child>Why Did Jennifer Jason Leigh Wait To Have A Child?</h2><p>Jennifer Jason Leigh (born Jennifer Lee Morrow) has had a long and successful career, with some of her most memorable performances in Single White Female, Dolores Claiborne, and The Hateful Eight (for which she was nominated for an Oscar in 2016). Her dramatic and impressive performances are nothing like her real life, something which she discussed in a 2018 interview with The Guardian.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Growing Up Changed Sean Preston Federline's Strained Relationship With His Mother, Britney Spears</a></span></p><p>"There was a time, when I was dating in my early 30s or late 20s, where people would meet me and think that I was going to be a wild or risk-taking dramatic young woman," she explained. "I've always avoided drama in my life. I just like it on screen."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She has worked as an actress from a young age, but only later in life did she meet director Noah Baumbach and the couple married in 2005. The pair reportedly met in 2001 while working on the production of the Broadway play Proof. Five years later, it was all over, with divorce documents citing "irreconcilable differences" and Leigh seeking physical custody of their child, Today reports. While their relationship was not meant to be, their time together did produce a son, Rohmer Emmanuel Baumbach.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/noah-baumbach-and-jennifer-jason-leigh.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news of their breakup shocked many, especially because there was a time when they seemed so happy together. Noah Baumbach had also shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he intended to be with Leigh forever</a>. Telling People Magazine shortly after their marriage in 2005, "I expect to be with [Leigh] for the rest of my life." Sadly, that was not meant to be, but they will always be joined in some way because they share a child.</p><h2 id=how-did-jennifer-jason-leigh-39-s-career-change-after-becoming-a-mother>How Did Jennifer Jason Leigh's Career Change After Becoming A Mother?</h2><p>For actresses, having a child can impact their career, and this was something that happened to Jennifer Jason Leigh. In a 2018 interview with The Guardian, the publication noted, "She did some plays and had a baby, and the job offers slowed." Regarding this period, Leigh explained that it "was very hard" for her. <a href=#>The film that turned everything around was The Hateful Eight</a>, directed by Quentin Tarantino.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Does Jennifer Jason Leigh Really Feel About 'Marriage Story'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some actresses have been critical of Tarantino, The Guardian notes. However, Leigh has nothing but praise for the director who, in a way, <a href=#>helped relaunch her career</a>. "I love Quentin, so all I can tell you is that he loves and is so respectful of everyone that he works with," she told the publication. "When you get on the set, it feels like a family. He knew more about my career than I did â€“ he was quoting things that I'd done for ever ago as if they were yesterday."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/alan-cumming-and-jennifer-jason-leigh.jpg><p>Another of her later roles has been in Netflix's Atypical and in the Safdie brothers' Good Time.

"I spend every moment when I'm not working doing things with my son," she said, according to Closer. "You make the most of the time you have."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Brooke Shields The Only Celebrity To Get A Mother-Daughter Tattoo?</a></span></p><p>Interestingly, she has not given many interviews about motherhood. Still, we did get a glimpse into her journey into becoming a mom when she gushed about the love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">you experience once your child is born</a>. In an interview with The Guardian, she said, "They say you have no idea what love is like until you have a child. It supersedes romantic love by such magnitude it's insane."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are <a href=#>challenges that come with motherhood</a>, whether you have your child young or wait until you are much older. For Leigh, later motherhood was the right choice, as she explained, "It's been ideal, in a certain way. You're ready to be selfless. You've had enough time for yourself." Despite no longer being married to Noah Baumbach, she did praise him as a parent, saying, "He has a good father. It's all very easy for me."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jennifer-jason-leigh-1.jpg><p>Leigh is now in her 60s and remains one of the most celebrated actresses of her time. She has enjoyed a long and successful career and shifted her attention to prioritizing another role, motherhood. Despite giving very few interviews about the subject, she appears to be a doting and dedicated mother and has managed to co-parent with her ex-husband. Her own childhood sounds like it was more complicated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Her father was actor and director Vic Morrow (who died in a helicopter accident in 1982 while filming The Twilight Zone), and her mother, Barbara Turner, was an actor and screenwriter. She described her father in an interview with The Guardian, noting he was a "very difficult" person. She continued, "We were not close. It's hard. I don't really talk about my father publicly, because there are a lot of people that really love him very, very much â€“ his work as an actor. I don't want to disabuse them [of] their admiration."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaenrOmvoyjmKynnmK5prXGoWSmp51irrV5k3FknKCZobGzsc1mqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
