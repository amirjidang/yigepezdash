In April last year, for instance, she found herself being <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cruelly trolled after she revealed that she was in a polyamorous relationship</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is not just her romantic life that has put her on the spotlight, however. The multi-talented daughter of Will and Jada Pinkett Smith has continued the heritage of her very accomplished family by building her own impressive body of artistic work.</p><p>She started her career when she featured in her father's film, I Am Legend in 2007. She however, first really gained acclaim in her own right when she released her debut single, Whip My Hair. Those days seem like an eternity ago now, given <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all the ways in which she has changed</a> and everything she has accomplished since.</p><p>With the legacy of her family behind her, and an impressive career of her own so far, Willow has managed to amass a significant net worth, currently estimated to be in the millions.</p><h2 id=willow-smith-started-to-earn-long-before-she-was-a-teenager>Willow Smith Started To Earn Long Before She Was A Teenager</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Willow started to earn her own money long before she was even a teenager. Whip My Hair was a phenomenal success just as a song, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the video she did for it</a> earned her very first major award nomination - for Video of the Year at the 2011 BET Awards.</p><p>Although she eventually lost out to Chris Brown, Lil Wayne and Busta Rhymes' Look at Me Now, the song became the launchpad of what has been a strong musical career. Her first-ever album was titled Ardipithecus, which she released in 2015 under Jay-Z's Roc Nation record label.</p><p>The album contained the song Wait a Minute, which would officially become her first ever platinum-certified single by the Recording Industry Association of America. Willow was only 15 at the time. The artist has continued relentlessly on her musical journey, with three more albums since: The 1st (2017), Willow (2019) and Lately I Feel Everything (2021).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Willow Smith's Polyamorous Lifestyle Sparks A Multi-Generational Debate</a></span></p><p>In 2018, she started co-hosting a brand new talk show called Red Table Talk on Facebook Watch, alongside her mother and grandmother - Jada's mother - Adrienne Banfield-Norris. The show has since featured a total of 103 episodes, and even won a Daytime Emmy award in 2021.</p><h2 id=39-red-table-talk-39-is-a-certified-money-maker-for-the-smith-family>'Red Table Talk' Is A Certified Money-Maker For The Smith Family</h2><p>Red Table Talk has become quite popular with audiences on social media, particularly thanks to some of the explosive discussions that have taken place in recent years. The show was of course the platform on which Willow first discussed her polyamorous lifestyle, in an episode titled Is Polyamory For You?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series has also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed quite a few surprising things about Willow's life</a>, including her battle with mental health issues, and the one time she walked in on her parents having sex. "I was going downstairs for some juice, and I saw for a little moment, and I ran away," she explained. "It was silhouetted."</p><p>Perhaps the most famous episode of Red Table Talk was Jada Brings Herself to the Table in July 2020, where Willow's parents sat down to discuss the history of their relationship and instances of infidelity.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Biggest Celebrity Reveals On Jada Pinkett-Smith's 'The Red Table Talk'</a></span></p><p>Red Table Talk has tens of millions of followers and subscribers across multiple social media channels. Seeing as it is also a Facebook-commissioned project, the show is a certified money-maker for Willow and the rest of her family members who are involved in it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willow-smith-has-a-net-worth-of-6-million>Willow Smith Has A Net Worth Of $6 Million</h2><p>Apart from Red Table Talk and her music, Willow has also dabbled a bit with acting, which is more of her parents' and brother Jaden's forte. After she featured in I Am Legend, she made a cameo as Countee Garby in Patricia Rozema's 2008 film, Kit Kittredge: An American Girl.</p><p>Since then, a lot of Willow's acting has mostly been in voice roles, originally in Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa and then Merry Madagascar in 2009. She has also voiced characters in the TV shows Neo Yokio, Adventure Time and most recently in We Baby Bears.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only other non-voice acting role that Willow has had was in two episodes of True Jackson, VP, the Nickelodeon teen sitcom that starred Keke Palmer. All these projects have kept the singer busy and paid ever since she was a kid.</p><p>Willow's $6 million net worth is currently the least in her family, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her brother Jaden being estimated to be worth around $8 million</a>. Their parents have a combined net worth of about $400 million, which would bring their total assets value as a family close to the $415 million mark.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Was Betty White Worth When She Passed Away?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoqScpMRuv8yiq6FlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
