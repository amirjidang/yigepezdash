However, there was one very noticeable absence in the pic: Jefferson White, who plays ranch hand Jimmy.&nbsp;It's entirely possible that White simply wasn't on set that day for any number of reasons. However, since the end of Season 3 sees Jimmy unconscious (or possibly dead)&nbsp;on the ground after bring thrown off a horse, fans were immediately concerned that the character had perished, and <a href=#>took to the comments</a> to <a href=#>plead for his whereabouts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a href=#>Reddit</a>&nbsp;thread suggests that Jimmy's fate was actually hinted at, because he was last shown wearing a baseball cap, rather than his cowboy hat â€” possibly signaling his time on the ranch was over. One user revealed, "I follow [White] on Instagram and on almost every post leading up to the finale, he mentions about the past week being difficult. Struck me as odd at the time, but now it is kinda making me wonder if his character plot ran its course?" There's also the matter of Jimmy's accident, with one user quipping, "I heard a huge 'snap' when Jimmy hit the ground. Broken neck??" Another advised, "The captions said 'crunch.'"&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href=#>Cinema Blend</a> notes, Jimmy had already survived one near-death experience in Season 3, suggesting it's highly unlikely he's survived two. But still, Yellowstone fans can hope.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kXBsbWxpZMGptdJmmqiklWK1osHSnqlmoZ6owaKz0ZqkZqifqMFutMCsZLKdnKG8uL%2FTqKWeZZaWu7R5yKdkmmWknse7xY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
