With a net worth of $259.8 billion, Musk is also the founder of SpaceX, Tesla, The Boring Company, and co-founder of Neuralink, OpenAI, and PayPal. The father of nine was born in South Africa to a Canadian mother and a South African father.<a href=#>He had a tough and dangerous childhood</a> and grew up with divorced parents and two younger siblings. Even after his major success and being one of the richest people on the planet, he learned that being a billionaire doesn't solve all the problems in the world. As Musk has complicated relationships with his parents, especially his father.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=elon-musk-had-a-miserable-childhood>Elon Musk Had A Miserable Childhood</h2><p>Even though Musk came from a wealthy family, he didn't live such a happy childhood. His father, Errol Musk, is an engineer, consultant, and property developer. He was a co-owner of an emerald mine in South Africa. Meanwhile, his mother, Maye Musk, is a Canadian model who has been modeling since she was a young woman. When his parents had him, his father was 28 years old and his mother was 23 years old.</p><p>When he was nine years old his parents got divorced and his life heavily changed. Initially, he was supposed to live with his mother and two younger siblings, but feeling sorry for his dad, he chose to live with him. Later on, Musk described his childhood as "miserable," and admitted that living with his father wasn't much of a good idea.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=elon-musk-s-mother-had-a-complicated-life-but-a-good-relationship-with-her-son>Elon Musk's Mother Had A Complicated Life, But A Good Relationship With Her Son</h2><p>Maye Musk has been allegedly abused by her ex-husband, Errol Musk. Being in South Africa, physical abuse was not a good enough reason to file for a divorce, until 1979 when the rules changed, and she got divorced. While Elon did not live with her after the divorce, the two maintained a healthy and good relationship over the years.</p><p><a href=#>The self-made millionaire, Maye Musk</a> was trending because she said once that she sleeps in Elon's garage, but it's not as bad as it sounds. When she visits him at the SpaceX pad in Boca Chica, she would have no other place to sleep other than in the garage. She said, “You can’t have a fancy house near a rocket site.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elon Musk’s Mother Makes History As Oldest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Model</a></span></p><p>Maye is publicly a very proud mother to three successful children.
