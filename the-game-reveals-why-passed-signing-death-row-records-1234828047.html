The Compton native found massive success with his chart-topping, multiplatinum debut The Documentary while on the label.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, the rapper says that prior to linking with 50 Cent and <a href=# id=auto-tag_dr-dre data-tag=dr-dre>Dr. Dre</a>, he nearly wound up signing to <a href=# id=auto-tag_death-row-records data-tag=death-row-records>Death Row Records</a>, but ultimately decided to pass on the opportunity. During a recent sit-down with VladTV, The Game recalled a period during the early ’00s when he would hang out with <a href=#>former Death Row Records CEO</a> <a href=# id=auto-tag_suge-knight data-tag=suge-knight>Suge Knight</a> and former Death Row artist Eastwood.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It was during this time he says that he realized that the legendary imprint wasn’t the right fit due to not feeling prioritized in comparison to the established Death Row artists. “I was running around with Suge and Eastwood and my homeboy Sonic for about two months and I figured out this wasn’t the place for me,” he said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1240912663.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I remember when they came out with I don’t know if it was XXL or The Source cover where they had Left Eye on there with Suge and Crooked I, Eastwood and I just felt like I should be on there.” Looking back, The Game admits that he may have been cocky and felt entitled at the time, but that his decision to secure a better situation for himself ultimately paid off.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That was the competitive nature of young West Coast ni**as back then,” he said of his brashness. “I just felt like I belonged on records. So I stopped f**king with them and then I <a href=#>started running with Diddy</a> a little bit and then Diddy sort of pushed me over to Dre when Dre was ready to sign me.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch The Game’s interview with VladTV below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m1pnnGmqSeZaKaw6aty6xksKCpYr2iv9Kem2armZy7qrrGZpuemaSderO71mapnpufp7G0eZBram1wYm19dYOO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
