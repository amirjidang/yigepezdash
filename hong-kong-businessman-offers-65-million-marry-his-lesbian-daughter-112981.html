The important thing is that he is generous and kind-hearted,” Chao said. “Gigi is a very good woman with both talents and looks. She is devoted to her parents, is generous and does volunteer work.”</p><p>According to the <a href=# rel=nofollow>South China Morning Post,</a> the announcement was made after his daughter Gigi Chao married her female partner, Sean Ev, of seven years in France several months ago. The article says that the 76-year-old business magnate says the marriage reports are “false.” <a href=# rel=nofollow>NBC News</a> reports same-sex marriage is not legally recognized in Hong Kong, although civil unions are performed in France.</p><p>The Post also describes Chao as “Hong Kong’s playboy tycoon.” Though he has never married himself, he says he would not force Gigi to give her hand to a man she did not love. Gigi is the first of three children he had with different women.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX528r7OMpKann12XwrS1zZ6qrKWRo3qwssWeqaxlZmp6rrXLpaCopl2irrO%2B2GafoqtdobK0rsiapWackaq0qcDEq2RqaWJuhXJ7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
