There was speculation that a female would replace Craig, but producer Barbara Broccoli has confirmed that the role will <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">continue to be played by a male</a>.</p><p>It could be a while until we find out which actor is cast as Craig's replacement. There will have been a gap of over four and a half years between the releases of Spectre (2015) and No Time to Die. If the wait is that long again, we may not learn of the next Bond actor for several years.</p><p>While we continue to play the guessing game, Ladbrokes (h/t the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Express</a>) has listed James Norton as the betting favorite to play 007.&nbsp;Norton, who is most popular for his roles in shows such as&nbsp;Happy Valley and War & Peace, carries 6/4 odds. Richard Madden has the second-highest odds at 4/1.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Former Bond Girl Doesn't Think A Female Should Replace Daniel Craig As 007</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Hiddleston and Sam Heughan are the next closest behind Norton and Madden with 4-1 odds. Heughan and Madden were <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">previously listed as the favorites</a> by Ladbrokes at 5/2 and 5/1, respectively.</p><p>It's worth noting, however, that Norton <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shut down the rumors of being cast</a> as the new James Bond during a recent interview with the Sunday Times. Norton stated "there is no truth behind" such rumors.</p><p>Other actors who've been mentioned as possible replacements for Craig include Idris Elba and Tom Hardy. There is no shortage of quality candidates who can suit up for the 007 role, but again, it could be a while until we learn of the next Bond actor. For now, all eyes are on No Time to Die, the milestone 25th film in the series.</p><p><strong>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lebron James Is The Highest-Earning American Athlete Of The 2010s</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8mapJ6rXaO8s8DOp2Snnadir6bA06KloGWWlsOwvsitnGasn2KvpnnNnq%2BtZZKku6V7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
