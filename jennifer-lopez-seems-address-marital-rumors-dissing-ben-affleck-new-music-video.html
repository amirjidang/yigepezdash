Some reports suggest Lopez even wanted to try couple’s therapy with Affleck following photo of the director embracing Garner were published in the fall.</p><p>While the reports remain unconfirmed, Lopez and Affleck’s’ marriage likely wasn’t helped by Britney Spears’ recent <a href=#>admission that she hooked-up with Affleck</a> back in the day (though the pop star claim she doesn’t really remember the encounter).
