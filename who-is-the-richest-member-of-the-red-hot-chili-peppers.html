Not only can they conquer radio and streaming, but these artists also get the chance to headline the largest music venues on the planet. Pop acts like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a> and rap acts like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem</a> do this regularly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rock music may not dominate like it did in the past, but that hasn’t stopped the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Hot Chili Peppers</a> from staying at the top of the industry. The legendary&nbsp;group has been among the biggest acts in the world since the 90s, and they have the net worths to show for it.</p><p>Let’s see which member of the band has the biggest bankroll!</p><h2 id=flea-is-on-top-at-150-million>Flea Is On Top At $150 Million</h2><p>The Red Hot Chili Peppers are a hugely successful band made up of talented musicians, and perhaps the most famous member of the group is none other than Flea. The iconic bassist has been popping and slapping the bass with the band since its inception in the 80s, and at this point, he has the highest net worth.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, the musician is currently sporting a net worth of $150 million. Yes, he has sold millions of records with the Chili Peppers, but a&nbsp;look at Flea’s body of work will reveal that he has been far busier than some would suspect.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only has he sold millions with the Chili Peppers, but he has also worked on music with huge musical acts like Alanis Morissette, Young MC, Johnny Cash, Incubus, and Bone-Thungs-N-Harmony. Naturally, the bassist has been compensated for his work, especially when he is given writing credits.</p><p>On top of being incredible in the studio and on stage, Flea has also been known to dabble in the world of acting. According to IMDb, Flea’s biggest roles have come in the&nbsp;Back to the Future franchise,&nbsp;The Wild Thornberrys,&nbsp;The Big Lebowski,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Toy Story 4. Sure, he’s not a household name as an actor, but he’s gotten around.</p><p>As nice as it is that he is tops in the band, the man in second place isn’t that far behind him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Rock Star Movie Cameos Ranked From Terrible To Epic</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=anthony-kiedis-is-a-close-second-at-140-million>Anthony Kiedis Is A Close Second At $140 Million</h2><p>As the lead singer of the Chili Peppers, Anthony Kiedis is a performer that millions of fans around the world have admired for quite some time. Sure, his signing may not be on the same level as Brandon Boyd, but Kiedis is a dynamic frontman who’s responsible for penning the band’s biggest hits.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth, Anthony Kiedis is worth $140 million, which is just shy of what Flea is rocking these days. Kiedis has made the vast majority of his money from his time in the band, and while he has done some work with other artists, his musical background is primarily with the Chili Peppers.</p><p>Much like his bandmate, Kiedis does have some acting credits to his name. According to&nbsp;IMDb, Anthony Kiedis has appeared in films like&nbsp;Point Break and&nbsp;Less Than Zero, though his credits are not nearly as extensive as Flea’s are.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of his endeavors with the band, Kiedis has also taken to investing, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox Business</a>. UFC fans are accustomed to seeing Kiedis at the promotion’s biggest events, and as a huge fan of the sport with deep pockets, it makes sense that the star would eventually invest in the promotion.</p><p>With two band members left, the third and fourth spot have a noticeable gap between each other, but there is more than meets the eye here.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Laura Prepon Once Dated This Famous Singer</a></span></p><h2 id=chad-smith-rocks-90-million-and-john-frusciante-has-20-million>Chad Smith Rocks $90 Million And&nbsp;John Frusciante Has $20 Million</h2><p>Drummer Chad Smith clocks in at the third spot here with a $90 million net worth. Smith, unlike Kiedis and Flea, is not an original member of the band, and his first album with the Chili Peppers was actually their fourth overall,&nbsp;Mother’s Milk. Since then, he has been banging away on the drums and has fueled the band’s biggest records for over 30 years now.</p><p>In the bottom slot is guitar virtuoso John Frusciante, who recently returned to the band after a lengthy hiatus. Frusciante’s first album with the band was&nbsp;Mother’s Milk, but he has been out of the lineup multiple times and did not appear on the albums&nbsp;One Hot Minute,&nbsp;I’m With You, and&nbsp;The Getaway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Frusciante was a busy man during his multiple stints away from the band, releasing his own solo music and working with other artists, but he was not selling out arenas and selling millions of records during those years, hence the large gap between he and the other members.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who Was Dave Navarro Before ‘Ink Master’?</a></span></p><p>The Chili Peppers’ classic lineup is intact with Frusciante back in the fold, and once they hit the road with a new record, these net worths are bound to increase.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">These Top Recording Artists Have New Music Planned For 2021</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZKuhk52ytMCMppymmpWnerCyjK2fnmWimrFutM6tZJygmaG2brzEqaeeqqNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
