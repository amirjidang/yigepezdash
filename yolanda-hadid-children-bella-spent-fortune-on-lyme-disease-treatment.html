She has been vulnerable and shared a lot of her journey, which of course means that people have opinions about it. For instance, <a href=#>David Foster's kids have criticized Yolanda</a> and the decisions that she has made surrounding her treatment.</p><p>Yolanda isn't the only person in her family who has suffered from this illness, though. According to People, Yolanda and two of her children, Bella and Anwar Hadid, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">received Lyme disease diagnoses in 2012</a></strong>. Dr. Raphael Kellman said "it's not uncommon" and added that they all got sick "because they share the same environment." Since Yolanda Hadid and two of her kids have Lyme disease, they must have dipped into their bank accounts quite a bit for various treatments over the years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-money-did-yolanda-hadid-and-children-bella-hadid-and-anwar-hadid-spend-on-treatment-for-lyme-disease>How Much Money Did Yolanda Hadid And Children Bella Hadid And Anwar Hadid Spend On Treatment For Lyme Disease?</h2><p>As The Cleveland Clinic noted, the typical <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lyme disease treatment</a> involves taking antibiotics such as amoxicillin or doxycycline. According to The New York Post, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yolanda Hadid wrote about Lyme disease</a> in her memoir "Believe Me," which was published in 2017.

Yolanda told The New York Post:</p><p>“I never kept a tally and I didn’t count it, but I can tell you that it’s a lot.

In 2021, E! News reported on his current wife <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katharine McPhee posting a family vacation picture</a> that seemed to include a private plane.

According to People, Yolanda had TVAM: Transvascular Autonomic Modulation. While there is no information about how expensive this surgery is, it's possible to assume that it costs at least tens of thousands of dollars given how pricey surgeries are.</p><p>What Is TVAM?</p><ul><li>"risky" and considered unsafe by the FDA (via Medscape.com)</li><li>"experimental procedure" (via Medscape.com)</li><li>a catheter and balloon are put into someone's jugular vein (via People)</li></ul><p>Since Yolanda shared an Instagram picture in a hospital bed, she could have had a pricey hospital stay. She posted a plane photo and mentioned working with Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt, who is the Sophia Health Institute lead clinician. She might have gotten surgery at Woodinville, Washington, where that clinic is located. If she didn't fly private, she would have had to pay for flights there and back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/did-selena-gomez-destroy-her-friendship-with-gigi-and-bella-hadid-after-the-zayn-malik-dating-rumors_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Did Selena Gomez Destroy Her Friendship With Gigi And Bella Hadid After The Zayn Malik Dating Rumors?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>With news that Selena Gomez unfollowed Zayn Malik, Gigi, and Bella Hadid, fans want to know what's really going on with these famous friendships.</span><p>While Yolanda Hadid's children Bella Hadid and Anwar Hadid haven't explained the various treatments that they have gotten for their own Lyme disease, it's possible that they did a few things that their mom did.

According to Today, when people have Lyme disease, they often get antibiotics this way. According to The Washington Post, an IV drip would set someone back $5,000 if they received IV drips for three weeks back in 1993. That cost has only gone up. According to a post on Lymedisease.org, the price for <strong>one week of IV drips in 2011 was $3,000.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/anwar-hadid-yolanda-hadid.jpg><p>In her same August 2023 Instagram post, Bella shared that she was <strong>"finally" better after 15 years</strong>.
