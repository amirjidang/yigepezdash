While the show wasn't as big a phenomenon as it turned into back then, the band still walked away with a pretty paycheck. Here's how much the Barenaked Ladies made from "The Big Bang Theory" theme song!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Much Did Jim Parsons Make For The Big Bang Theory?</a></span></p><h2 id=a-big-and-bangin-theme-song>A Big And Bangin' Theme Song</h2><p>"The Big Bang Theory" was without a doubt one of the most popular shows on television, and they sure had one of the most iconic theme songs! While theme songs from shows such as "Cheers", "Friends", or "The Fresh Prince Of Bel-Air" have certainly stuck over time, "The Big Bang Theory" is certainly joining the ranks. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The theme song was written and recorded by the Barenaked Ladies</a>. The Canadian rock group,&nbsp;which is made up of members Ed Robertson, Kevin Hearn, Jim Creeggan, Tyler Stewart, Andy Creeggan and formerly, Steven Page, recorded the song back in 2007 and made a whopping $1 million!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the exact number is an estimate from the band's former member, Steven Page, it seems as if this is very plausible! Considering the band wrote the song, they own the rights, which gains them access to royalties, so a number like that almost seems like it isn't' enough. Most artists who commission work for television shows or commercials will often be given the song, however, in the Barenaked Ladies case, they had more of a chance to play around with their contracts in order to secure print, performance and synchro rights to the song, meaning they will be making money off of it for quite some time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Most Big Bang Theory Fans Don't Know About Penny</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This topic came back up in 2015 when it was revealed that former band frontman, Steven Page, who left the group in 2009,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> sued&nbsp;the band for never having received a single penny </a>from the theme song. Page claims that he was entitled to 20 percent of all profit made off of "The Big Bang Theory", however, he has not received anything. According to Steven, the only member of the group who has, in fact, received compensation from royalties is Ed Roberston.</p><p>It was during his legal pursuit that Steven Page revealed he believed the amount to have been made from their song is in "excess of $1 million". If he's truly entitled to 20 percent, that means Page was being left out of a $200,000 deal. So, it is safe to say that we certainly understand his frustration!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>15 Sweet Photos Of The Big Bang Theory Cast Out Of Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dosKktIydoJ1lpJ2ybq7Aq5ynmZuasW64wJ2gnqtdnLK1ec%2BaoJ1llqS%2FbsDHnmSboZdir6K6xmaroZ2fp8ZuwMeepJ5lo6S7qHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
