He just had that swagger.”</p><p>Pascal, 48, for his part has been candid about how he struggled to get roles at the beginning of his career.</p><p>“I was getting my ass f–king kicked,” Pascal told <a href=#>Esquire</a> in April 2023, recalling the years he lived in New York City as a struggling actor. “I guess that, and this delusional self-determination, and no real skill at anything else, is what kept me going.”</p><p>While he didn’t nab The Originals role, years prior, Pascal appeared in another vampire series. Following<a href=#> The Last of Us premiere in January</a>, fans started to unearth Pascal’s past TV appearances and post them to TikTok. One of the most talked-about was his one-episode stint as Eddie on <a href=#>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>.</p><p>“What I just found out — which I am very excited about, and I can’t wait to get my phone back so that I can look it up myself — is that <a href=#><strong>Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong></a> remembers me,” Pascal told <a href=#>Access</a> at The Mandalorian premiere in March. “I remember every moment of shooting that episode, as brief as it was. She was such a kind scene partner, and we had the best time.”</p><p>Pascal was, of course, referring to the moment Gellar, 46, posted a still of their Buffy scene <a href=#>on Instagram writing</a>, “When #Mother met #Father.”</p><p>He went on to say that it was “a super big deal” for him to play Eddie in the show’s season 4 premiere. Recalling the episode’s plot Pascal said he got to “hang out” with Gellar for “a little bit” onscreen, but when they parted ways he gets turned into vampire and is eventually killed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Paul-Wesley-Reveals-Pedro-Pascal-Auditioned-for-%E2%80%98The-Originals-%E2%80%94-But-Didnt-Get-the-Part2.jpg><p>Pascal gushed that he could remember “absolutely everything” from his day on the Buffy set in 1999 during a separate interview with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I remember [Gellar] had ice cream in her trailer, and she gave me some,” he said. “She went back to her trailer, she got me some ice cream and she shared — ’cause it was a night shoot, it was in the middle of the night, and we were on the UCLA campus. They hadn’t built their college sets yet.”</p><p>He added, “I was doing a play in Long Beach, and I had to miss opening night because we had to shoot this very, very short moment. I remember everything. I could go on, and on and on. I could give you step by step, every detail.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKearZxixKa%2Fy56wZqqVq7KiuNJmp56coqR6sa3SnJilZZGqsarAyKilnpxdm7yzedOhnGanop60qrrApapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
