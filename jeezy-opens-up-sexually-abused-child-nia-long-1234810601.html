The two discussed his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">recent divorce </a>from The Real host <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Jeannie Mai</a> and much more.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">At the beginning of the conversation, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Friday </a>actress inquired about when his trauma began. “I think it was several things,” The Snowman said. “I think the first was being left with a babysitter that was a woman that was older than me and her, you know, touching me and doing things to me that don’t normally happen to kids.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Nia Long, seeking clarity, asked, “Like molesting?” to which Jeezy replied, “Right, basically.” He continued, labeling that moment as him being “introduced to sex at a very young age.” Check out the full interview above.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The former Boyz N Da Hood member’s recent album, I Might Forgive… But I Don’t Forget, was a 29-track double album with, notably, no featured artists. The first half includes production by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ATL Jacob</a>, Ricky Polo, Hendrix, and more. In contrast, the second half is solely produced by J.U.S.T.I.C.E. League, whom he has worked with countless times throughout his extensive discography.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The album also marked a new chapter in his career. Jeezy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">left Def Jam</a> after being signed to the legendary label for almost 20 years and now operates under his CTE New World imprint. His final Def Jam project was the October 2022 release <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">SnoFall</a>, which was a collaborative Gangsta Grillz effort alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DJ Drama</a>.
