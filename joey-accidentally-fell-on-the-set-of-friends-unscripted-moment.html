Lasting for ten seasons, the iconic sitcom is incredibly easy to watch due to its light-hearted nature.

Given how hilarious the moment turned out to be during season two, it was kept in the sitcom.</p><h2 id=there-were-a-few-unscripted-moments-39-friends-39-decided-to-leave-in>There Were A Few Unscripted Moments 'Friends' Decided To Leave In</h2><p>What made 'Friends' that much greater is the fact that the show operated differently. If something was unfunny or didn't get the proper audience reaction, they would reshoot it on the spot. According to Matthew Perry, this was a brilliant approach and something other shows would never dare to do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>An example of this took place in 'The One In Vegas', when <a href=#>Lisa Kudrow herself asked the audience if they understood her joke</a>. Once it was clear that they did, the show moved on with the next scene.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Why Filming Emma's Birth On 'Friends' Brought Courteney Cox To Tears</a></span></p><p>Not only did adjustments take place on fly, but unscripted moments were also kept in the show during various seasons. A prime example of one, took place during season 6 in 'The One After Vegas'. Rachel uttered one of the most memorable lines, stating that her marriage with Ross was "the world's worst hangover." The added line received quite the reaction from the live audience, so much so that during the editing process, <a href=#>they needed to adjust the laughter</a> due to the fact that it ran for too long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chandler also gets some love for so many brilliant unscripted moments, one that comes to mind is how the actor was able to keep it together after smashing his own head with a cabinet during the season 4 episode, 'The One with the Cuffs.'</p><h2 id=it-wasn-39-t-the-first-time-matt-leblanc-fell-on-set>It Wasn't The First Time Matt LeBlanc Fell On-Set</h2><p>When fans read the title, likely the first moment they thought about was Matt LeBlanc tripping on his feet, a moment that made the blooper-reel. We're not talking about that moment, however, it will always be regarded as one of the very best outtakes in the show's history. Even during the reunion, the cast discussed and relived the hilarious moment with Matt LeBlanc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Courteney Cox Said This 'Friends' Cast Member Was The Worst At Memorizing Their Lines</a></span></p><p>Not only did Matt remember the moment perfectly, but the fans were still drawn into the blooper, as the outtake has a near two million views on platforms like YouTube. Fans had a lot to say about the iconic moment involving LeBlanc.</p><p>"It’s like watching your elders reminisce about the good old days, but actually having the footage lol. It really makes you appreciate youth a lot more and want to take in all the moments of life."</p><p>"Matt was so serious with his job, you could see how he felt genuinely sorry and cutely embarrassed when he did something wrong... He is so precious."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I love how Matt constantly tripped during his takes. There was one instance where Joey was impersonating a guy named Bob, and he was supposed to pick up the phone and say "Bob here." But while filming, Matt fell down, and it was funnier than the scripted version, that they left it in!"</p><p>Speaking of the "Bob here" episode, that's exactly where the hilarious unscripted moment took place!</p><h2 id=joey-hilariously-fell-while-trying-to-answer-the-call-from-chandler-39-s-mystery-girl>Joey Hilariously Fell While Trying To Answer The Call From Chandler's Mystery Girl</h2><p>The unscripted moment can be viewed by the fans in the video below thanks to Ms Mojo via YouTube. <strong>The moment in question takes place at the 5:00 minute mark </strong>of the compilation video.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>​​​​​The episode aired way back in mid-October, 1995. It was during season two and episode five titled, 'The One with Five Steaks and an Eggplant'. One of the plots during the episode saw Chandler take advantage of his mistaken identity.</p><p>However, during the final moment of the show while the credits rolled, Joey is seen lunging at the phone when the person calls back.</p><p>What wasn't supposed to happen was LeBlanc completely whipping out and falling while attempting to do so.</p><p>This time around, unlike his previous outtake, the moment was kept in the show given how hilarious it truly was.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT - <a href=#>'Friends' Decided To Shoot But Later Cut This Phoebe And Her "Medicine" Storyline</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqJ2pYq6kr8idnKeskaG5unnFnqOlZZ%2BjerW0xGaqnqxdpLNustGinKeco2LCr7%2FCq6CprJWZeq67zJ6lrWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
