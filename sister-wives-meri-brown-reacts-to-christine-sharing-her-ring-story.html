Beyond,” Meri, 52, confesses in&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>’s exclusive sneak peek at the Sunday, December 3, episode of the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Sister Wives</i>&nbsp;tell-all</a>, which is part of the multi-episode reunion. “After we did the taping for the 1-on-1 interviews with Suki, I found out that a story was brought up about me that is not a story that I have ever shared publicly.”</p><p>Meri gets choked up as she explains, “That is my story to tell when, where and how I want to. And somebody else took it upon themselves to tell that story. And now I’m being forced to talk about it. I’m not happy about it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Meri-Brown-Gets-Choked-Up-After-Christine-Shares-Her-Wedding-Ring-Story-Without-Consent-on-Sister-Wives-1.jpg><p>Meri is referring to Christine, 51, getting candid about Meri and&nbsp;<b>Kody Brown</b>’s relationship prior to <a href=#>their January break up</a>. Christine details the history of Kody’s wedding ring in&nbsp;<i>Us</i>’ exclusive teaser from the upcoming episode. (Meri previously spotted Kody, 54, with a new ring that appeared to be from fourth wife&nbsp;<b>Robyn Brown</b>&nbsp;on an <a href=# rel=noopener>October episode</a> of the TLC series.)</p><p>“There’s a backstory here. I don’t feel like it’s all the way my place, but here we are,” Christine says in the video, sharing that when <a href=#>Meri and Kody tied the knot</a> in 1990 they each had a wedding ring.</p><p>According to Christine, Kody continued to wear the ring for years but once Robyn, 45, entered the picture it seemed to disappear. Meri and Kody legally divorced in 2014 so Kody could marry Robyn and adopt her three children from a prior marriage. Meri and Kody <a href=#>remained spiritually married</a> until their 2023 split.</p><p>“He melted down the ring, saved the gold, saved the diamonds,” Christine claims of the initial jewelry item in the upcoming episode. “Well, Meri found out she’s like, ‘Well, where’s my ring? You don’t wear it anymore.’ He’s like, ‘I melted it down’. Just like that. He’s like, ‘I didn’t want Meri to have control over me and power over me anymore.’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Meri-Brown-Gets-Choked-Up-After-Christine-Shares-Her-Wedding-Ring-Story-Without-Consent-on-Sister-Wives-2.jpg><p>Christine notes that following the ring drama, she and all of Kody’s then-wives gifted him a new band called a Claddagh ring, which is a Celtic accessory meant to symbolize love, loyalty and friendship. He wore it for years — as did Meri, Christine, Robyn and&nbsp;<b>Janelle Brown</b>&nbsp;— <a href=#>before he split</a> from Christine in 2021 and Janelle, 54, in 2022. Kody was later spotted with a new ring while filming season 18, which tapped in 2022.</p><p>While Meri did comment on Kody’s “different” ring during an October&nbsp;<i>Sister Wives</i>&nbsp;episode, she didn’t anticipate her comments on the jewelry would lead to Christine sharing her own ring story publicly.</p><p>“It was <a href=#>not Christine’s business</a> to tell,” Meri says in&nbsp;<i>Us’</i>&nbsp;first look at the new episode. “If I wanted to have shared that story in the last 13 years in a public way, I would have done that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Watch both Christine and Meri discuss the wedding ring controversy in <i>Us Weekly</i>’s exclusive video above.</p><p>Part 2 of&nbsp;<i>Sister Wives: 1-on-1</i>&nbsp;airs on TLC Sunday at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqiq6Sav27DyK%2BcrGWdmr%2BqecGrprCmXaeyoq%2FTrGStp12YtbO10q2gp51dqLWivsinnmaglad6s7XNoGSsrJ%2BnxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
