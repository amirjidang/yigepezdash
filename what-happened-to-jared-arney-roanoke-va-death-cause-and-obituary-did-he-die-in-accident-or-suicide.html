The websites with his obituary don’t provide any hints aside from him being from Roanoke.</p><p>We found a person with the same name as Jared. He is also from the same place. He is a&nbsp;physical therapist&nbsp;at Results Physiotherapy, who completed his bachelor’s from James Madison University in 2017 and Doctor of Physical Therapy from High Point University in 2021.</p><p>If they are the same person, then we express our deepest condolences.
