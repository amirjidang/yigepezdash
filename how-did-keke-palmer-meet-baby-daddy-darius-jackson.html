Yet, the entertainer, who has had a busy month so far, is not busy acting right now. The Illinois native has started her month with a new T-shirt line <a href=#>that's likely to grow her net worth</a> and a rather public spat with her baby daddy, Darius Jackson.</p><p>The couple may or may not still be together, but fans are still wondering how the outspoken fitness enthusiast and the famous entertainer met in the first place.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Keke Palmer Was Rumored To Have Dated A Small Number of Celebrities Before Seeing Her Current Husband Darius Jackson</a></span></p><h2 id=keke-palmer-met-her-baby-daddy-through-his-brother>Keke Palmer Met Her Baby Daddy Through His Brother</h2><p>Keke Palmer has been in a number of interesting and successful projects over the years, including making an appearance on the show Insecure. While on set, she met Darius Jackson's brother, Sarunas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The two became friendly. At a Memorial Day Party in 2021, he introduced her to his brother, Darius, who quickly fell head-over-heels for the beautiful star.</p><p>For her birthday that year, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote her a beautiful tribute on Instagram</a>, which is no longer available as a result of their falling out.</p><p>"You've been a blessing from above. I'm glad we were able to help each other throughout our lowest of times & show one another that what we are bringing to the table is everything that we got," he wrote.</p><p>While the relationship has gone through some upheaval from the beginning, <a href=#>the pair was, for the most part, very private</a>. Keke deleted many posts about Darius from her accounts in 2022, later justifying her actions on the Tamron Hall Show.</p><p>She said the relationship "became more difficult to hide. We spend all this time together, and he really is my closest friend, so it just becomes a thing where I'm not gonna hide something that makes me happy."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, during the best times with Darius, Keke was open about her feelings for him. Back in 2021, she called him her safe space; "I will always cherish what you have given me," she added.</p><h2 id=who-is-darius-jackson>Who Is Darius Jackson?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/what-happened-between-keke-palmer-and-darius-jackson_-i.jpg><p>Darius Jackson, who's better known as Darius Daulton, is a fitness enthusiast and entertainer. He received a football scholarship from Fresno State University and is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">currently involved with boxing and working out</a>. His brother, Sarunas, who introduced him to Keke, is also a former football player.</p><p>Darius has a few projects on the go. He is considering becoming a sports media commentator after getting a certificate in broadcasting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=#> Who Is Keke Palmer's Boyfriend, Darius Jackson?</a></span></p><p>However, he also markets himself as a writer on his Instagram profile and has considered becoming a YouTuber, although his account only managed to get just under 20,000 subscribers.</p><p>Darius has also worked on a TV show, Games People Play, with his brother, Karrueche Tran. He appeared in Dawn of the Predator, which is currently in post-production but may be released later this year.</p><p>According to his fitness profile, Darius said that his inspiration comes from "seeing the success of my friends & family around me." He also hinted that he has not always been in a good place, mentally, saying that his greatest achievement has been to get his life back on track.</p><p>More amusingly, he shared that he hated tomatoes in response to the question about which "healthy" foods he dislikes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=keke-and-her-boyfriend-had-a-public-spat>Keke And Her Boyfriend Had A Public Spat</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/keke-palmer-was-rumored-to-have-dated-a-small-number-of-celebrities-before-seeing-her-current-husband-darius-jackson.jpg><p>Following Keke Palmer's appearance at a Las Vegas Usher show in early July, Darius Jackson criticized her choice of an outfit for the night, claiming it was unbecoming for a mother. Keke had worn a revealing bodysuit covered by a sheer dress. Her baby daddy called her out, tweeting, "It's the outfit tho.. you a mom."</p><p>After receiving backlash for his tweet from fans, he doubled down, claiming it was his right to express his "standards & morals."</p><p>"This is my family & my representation. I rest my case," he said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later, Keke kicked off her new line of T-shirts, proudly sporting the logo "Motha." She captioned it by saying, "One thing is certain and one thing is true, IM A MOTHA, through and through." This was a subtle comeback at Darius, unlike his very public criticisms of her.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Oddly Hilarious Way Keke Palmer Found Out She Was Pregnant</a></span></p><p>Following the public spat, Darius Jackson deleted Keke's pictures from his Instagram (while keeping pictures of their son, Leodis) and does not follow her anymore. For a short while after the backlash against him on Twitter, Darius also deactivated his account, although he's back on Twitter now and seems to deny having deactivated his account.</p><p>For her part, Keke also unfollowed Darius on Instagram, although she hasn't gone through the trouble of deleting pictures.</p><p>Nevertheless, there is no confirmation that Keke Palmer and Darius Jackson have split up. Despite their drastic recent actions, they may well be still together and working to heal their rift. Fans will have to wait until either one decides to break the silence to find out whether they are still an item.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecqeop5loJa5rrHRZqSenaRir6Ku2GabmpyUrnqlrdGirKxlmpawrL%2FOp2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
