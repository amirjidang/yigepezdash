Their love story unfolded in a lovely but unusual way.</p><p>Let’s find everything about Ellen Pompeo’s husband, Chris Ivery!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>One of the Highest-Paid Actresses, Ellen Pompeo</h2><p>Ellen is an <a href=#>American actress </a>and producer who was born on November 10, 1969. Since 2017, she’s been a regular on Forbes’ year-end rankings of the world’s highest-paid actors.&nbsp;</p><p>Pompeo has indeed been shortlisted for a Golden Globe and has received a Screen Actors Guild Award.</p><p>Pompeo was born in Everett, Massachusetts, and then moved to Miami and then New York City, in which a casting director discovered her and put her in a L’Oreal commercial.</p><p>Shonda Rhimes’ ABC medical television drama Grey’s Anatomy cast Pompeo in her first significant role in 2005.&nbsp;</p><p>Meredith Grey, the series’ heroine, and the main character has been a surgical intern at the fictitious Seattle Grace Hospital since the pilot episode.</p><p>Grey’s Anatomy was a smash hit in 2005 and earned positive reviews from reviewers.</p><p>Notwithstanding her reputation as one of Hollywood’s <a href=#>top celebrities</a>, she has remained relatively anonymous and uses almost no Facebook and Twitter.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ellen Pompeo’s Husband, Chris Ivery</h2><p>Chris Ivery is really no stranger to the<a href=#> world of entertainment</a>, though, unlike Pompeo, Ivery prefers music to film. He worked as a music producer for most of his career, according to Us Weekly, and his talent can be heard in Rihanna and Ciara’s music.</p><p>Not only he is good at producing music, with the relaunch of Sergio Tacchini’s athletic line in 2019, but Ivery also shifted his focus to <a href=#>fashion</a> designing.</p><p>Chris was born and reared in the state of Massachusetts in the United States.

It was two years prior to her breakout role on the blockbuster medical TV show, Grey’s Anatomy.</p><p>The coincidences when they met for the first time were magical and hard to believe. Throughout a 2003 initial chat, the two realized that they grew up about 10 miles apart in Boston, Massachusetts, and were taken aback by the coincidence.</p><p>At first, their relationship was a platonic one. “We were buddies for six months,” Ivery said in an interview. “Then one night she just looked different to me.”</p><p>Soon after they became good friends, they started dating for years and finally decided to tie a knot. In their love story, Chris Ivery was the first one to propose to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris proposed Pompeo in November 2006, 3 years after their chance encounter at a grocery store with a 3.5-carat diamond engagement ring. On November 9, 2007, he said his “I do” in New York City Hall.</p><p>Although a city hall wedding may appear low-key, Pompeo and Ivery’s event was performed by former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. It was on another level and a beautiful night.</p><p>Pompeo gave birth to the couple’s first daughter, Stella Luna, on September 15, 2009, according to Us Weekly. Sienna May and Eli Christopher, the pair’s next two kids, were born in 2014 and 2016.</p><p>Sienna May, their second child, was delivered with the help of a surrogate in August 2014.

A lot of people get very nervous when you bring it up, and I understand why they do, but I am not afraid,” she revealed it to Jada Pinkett Smith on Red Table Talk in 2018.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Ivery Was Not a Fan of Pompeo’s Kissing Scenes</h2><p>During their days on Grey’s Anatomy, Ellen Pompeo’s spouse wasn’t really in a favor of her repeated intimating scenes with Patrick Dempsey.</p><p>The ABC medical drama is entering its 18th season, and Pompeo’s Meredith Grey has been at the core of the show since its inception.</p><p>Meredith’s romance with Dempsey’s Derek Shepherd ended in disaster in season 11 when he died too soon, but their romance remains a key part of her journey.</p><p>According to an interview with Instyle, Ellen Pompeo told:</p><p><br>“Poor guy had no idea what he was getting into. I remember in the beginning it was really hard for him. He was like ‘This is not what I signed up for. You go to work and make out with that. I like Patrick and everything, he’s a good dude, but like really?'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Having earnings of $14.9 million in 2016, Pompeo was rated fourth on Forbes’ list of highest-paid TV actresses, now she has an estimated net worth of $23.6 million in 2018.
