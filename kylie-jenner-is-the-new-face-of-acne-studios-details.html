The announcement was accompanied with a new ad campaign in promotion of the label’s fall/winter 2023 denim campaign.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In shots taken by Dutch photographer and director <strong>Carlijn Jacobs</strong>, Jenner was covered in dark body paint — that resembled gasoline and dirt — while modeling Acne Studios’ latest designs, which all feature “distressed” details and “dirty washes.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>For one snap, Jenner could be seen rocking an oversized jacket with <a href=#>baggy jeans</a>. In a different image, the TV personality went topless, modeling loose pants with pointed-toe heels.

The picture captured Jenner dragging the leg of her doppelgänger across the floor. In the image, Jenner rocked a denim trench coat and a jean bra.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“I love the organic relationship I’ve built with Acne Studios,” Jenner said in a press release. “I am a fan of the brand, and I’ve worn their product over the past few years. This campaign is one of my favorites. I loved working with Carlijn, and I love the simplicity of the images, they have strength in their directness.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Jacobs praised Jenner in return. “The campaign sought to showcase Kylie as a woman who is in control, <a href=#>has love for herself</a> and is unafraid to embrace her desires,” the photographer gushed. “I aimed to celebrate her individuality by doubling her. She loves herself and is not afraid to show it.”&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Kylie-Jenner-Is-the-Face-of-Acne-Studios-2.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Acne Studios creative director <strong>Jonny Johansson</strong> explained the vision behind the line, sharing in the news release, “Denim is one of those rebellious but practical materials that is always attractive to me.”&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Johansson added, “I think of denim as the axle for everything else in your wardrobe — all your clothes revolve around denim. It’s an endlessly important material that I love to reinvent every season.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s1>Last year, during <a href=#>Paris Fashion Week</a>, Jenner sat front row at the Acne Studios spring/summer runway show.
