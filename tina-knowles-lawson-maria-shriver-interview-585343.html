Not wanting Solange to feel the way she did growing up, Knowles-Lawson took special measures to ensure both her daughters knew they were loved.</p><p>“I had days that I devoted to [each of them]. On Wednesdays, I took off from work and that was Solange’s day. She was a lot younger than Beyoncé and it was tough because [Beyoncé] was five years older and Beyoncé was this little superstar in our city,”&nbsp;Knowles Lawson said.</p><p>The former hairstylist and seamstress also wanted Beyonce to understand her little sister simply wanted to hang around, and she hoped counseling would help.</p><p>“I took them to counseling so that, very early, the counselor could help Beyoncé be more sensitive to <a href=#>Solange,</a>” Knowles-Lawson explained. “She couldn’t stand her for a minute. You know, they were little, [Solange] was all in her stuff, trying to hang around her and her friends and Beyoncé was really irritated but it made her more sensitive to who her sister was and what she had to deal with because of her.”</p><p>While <a href=#>Beyonce</a> has gone on to became a master performer and entertainer, Solange has also carved out her own lane as one of the most artistic and thought–provoking singers of this generation. Yet despite their individual success, Solange and Beyonce are fiercely protective of each other so it looks like Knowles-Lawson’s efforts worked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6m2r62MpKWor5yawG64wLCqqKZdoq6ztcBmqqGqmauys3nIp6ueqqaesrh5lHFsbGxjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
