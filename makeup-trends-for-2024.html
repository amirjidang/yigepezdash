The start of the new year is a perfect time to revaluate your habits and goals — and try something new in the process! And luckily for you, the makeup trends that are predicted to take over 2024 are super attainable. Whether you’re a beauty novice or bonafide professional, the four makeup trends below will have you looking your best all year — all you need is a little blush, and you’ll be well on your way.</p><p>(And if you want to revitalize your closet, be sure to check out our <a href=# rel=noopener>2024 fashion trends guide</a>&nbsp;too!)</p><h2>Girly-Girl Vibes</h2><p>This makeup trend goes hand in hand with the ultra-feminine fashion styles that are gaining traction in 2024. Think flirty glossy lips, rosy cheeks, doll-like eyelashes and pretty pink nails.</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Blow a Kiss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">This Too Faced Injection Gloss</a> imparts an enviable shine across your lips and also dramatically plumps your pout. Wearing this will leave your lips voluminous and hydrated. Be warned: People will question whether you got lip fillers — it’s that good.</p><p><strong>2. Natural Flush:&nbsp;</strong>Swipe the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Pixi On-The-Glow Blush</a> along the apples of your cheeks for an instant pop of color. The creamy formula melts into skin, making it look like you’re naturally blushing — while the handy stick format makes it easy to apply and go.</p><p><strong>3. Doll Eyes:&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes, mascara isn’t enough to provide an wide-eyed effect. To really play up your peepers, try <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ardell’s fan-favorite Wispies false eyelashes</a>.</p><p><strong>4. Pretty in Pink:&nbsp;</strong>Is there anything girlier than a pink manicure? The <span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Sally Hansen Insta-Dri Fast-Dry Nail Color in Racing Rose</a> is the perfect pale pink hue which looks incredible on all skin tones. Plus, it actually dries in 60 seconds.&nbsp;</span></p><h2>Let Your Skin Shine</h2><p>It’s time to toss the full coverage foundation and embrace your natural skin.&nbsp;<strong>Pamela Anderson</strong> made headlines late last year for opting to go completely makeup free on the red carpet, and we predict that she will start a major firestorm, giving people the confidence to let their skin shine. I suggest looking for light skin tints or tinted sunscreen to give your complexion a dewy sheen.</p><p><strong>5. Perfectly Protected: </strong>I haven’t used a drop of foundation since trying the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Kosas DreamBeam Comfy Smooth Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 40</a>. This light-as-air tinted sunscreen infuses my skin with much-needed moisturizer and seamlessly evens out uneven tone — all while protecting me from the sun’s harsh rays.</p><p><strong>6. Double Duty: </strong>Skincare meets makeup in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">this sheer tinted essence from Covergirl</a> that’s formulated with bakuchiol (a vegan retinol alternative) and tranexamic acid. Along with evening out skin tone, it helps to reduce wrinkles and diminish dark spots over time.</p><p><strong>7. You’re Glowing! </strong>You don’t have to wait until sunset to achieve that golden hour glow when you use the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Versed Mood Lighting Luminizing Glow Drops</a>. Mix it into your moisturizer or massage a few drops right onto your complexion for an ethereal glow that lasts all day.</p><p><strong>8. Luxury for Less: </strong>YSL Beauty created their NU line at a more affordable price point than the rest of its line — but that doesn’t mean the formulas skimp out on quality. The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">YSL NU Bare Look Tint</a> is one of my all time favorite complexion products because of the way it works overtime as a moisturizer and skin tint. After a full day’s wear, it doesn’t look cakey or feel drying. 10/10!</p><h2>Monochromatic Makeup</h2><p>This minimal-effort trend is so easy to complete. Why? Because you literally need just one product. It’s all about using the same hue across your eyes, cheeks and lips to create a simple cohesive look.</p><p><strong>9. </strong><strong>One and Done:&nbsp;</strong>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nudestix </a><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Nudies Bloom Dewy and Radiant Cream Blush</a> is essentially the ultimate product for this trend, as it was touted as a three-in-one formula before monochromatic makeup became cool. Choose between 12 gorgeous shades ranging from Rusty Rouge to Juicy Melons!</span></p><p><strong>10. Multi-Use Dream: </strong>It’s all in the name — the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Ilia Multi-Stick</a> can be swiped along the apples of your cheek, pout and eyes for a glowing look that takes mere seconds to complete.</p><p><strong>11. A Celeb Favorite: </strong>This cult-favorite <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Convertible Color from Stila</a> has a ton of fans — <a href=# rel=noopener>including <strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a><strong>!</strong> Her favorite color is Peony, a brownish-rose.</p><p><strong>12. Talk About a Bargain: </strong>This little <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mini chubby stick from Inc.Redible</a> will last you for years… and it costs less than $15!</p><h2>We’re Blushing</h2><p>If there’s one makeup item you should never leave the house without in 2024, it’s blush. Don’t be afraid to experiment with color — we’re seeing reds, corals and bright pinks trending. These hues add a beautiful liveliness to your face with just a few taps.</p><p><strong>13. Bomb Dot Com: </strong>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Tower 28 BeachPlease Luminous Tinted Balm</a> is my favorite blush&nbsp;of all time.&nbsp;It really melts into my complexion and gives me a gorgeous sheen — without any glitter or added sparkles. My go-to shade is Magic Hour.</p><p><strong>14. Top Amazon Seller: </strong>Over 36,000 Amazon shoppers can’t get enough of this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Milani Baked Blush</a> because of its longevity and glowy finish… oh, and the $9 price point.</p><p><strong>15. Universally Flattering: </strong>It’s a known fact: Everyone looks good in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">NARS Blush in shade Orgasm</a>. Pro-tip: The mini pan lasts an extremely long time and is half the price of the full size!</p><p><strong>16. No Sparkle Here: </strong>Prefer to keep things matte? The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Charlotte Tilbury Matte Beauty Blush Wand</a> imparts a breathtaking color sans shimmer. I love that the handy wand allows me to place the blush exactly where I want it as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOppiknaWlerW%2BxKebrGWWpL9ufo9ra2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
