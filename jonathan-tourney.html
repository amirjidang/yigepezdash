He was on the school’s football team. He is described as an active kid who loves ice skating, fishing, and adventure sports. Coach LeDonne spoke with the local media and called the crash tragic. The tourney family had been through a lot with the death of their father earlier this year.

In an interview with a local news magazine, he said, “I’ve known Jonathan since he’s been a baby,” he continued, “Everything he does, he does it 150%.”</p><p>He set up the fundraiser to help Jonathan’s mother, Ellie.

The fundraiser raised over 62,000 dollars in less than four hours.
