Even more interesting, it <a href=#>seems they have a bromance going on</a>.</p><h2 id=fans-got-excited-when-double-dates-started-happening>Fans Got Excited When Double Dates Started Happening</h2><p>It is unclear how Krasinski and Reynolds first met. Although, one could imagine that they would have a lot to talk about since both are parents to young children. Coincidentally, both actors have daughters (Krasinski has two girls while Reynolds has three).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That said, before anyone even realized that the two were talking, these men started going on double dates together. Back in 2018, the actors were spotted with their spouses in New York City. Krasinski and his wife, Emily Blunt, wore matching black sweaters while Reynolds and wife Blake Lively coordinated in black and white outfits. That night, the happy foursome had stepped out to attend a screening of Stanley Tucci’s movie, Final Portrait, at the Guggenheim Museum.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>What Jenna Fischer Really Thought Of John Krasinski When They First Met</a></span></p><p>As it turns out too, Blunt and Lively are good friends themselves. In fact, the two women even attended the Michael Kors fall-winter 2018 fashion show together. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While speaking with E!</a>, Lively even remarked how well Blunt managed to shed off her baby weight after giving birth. “This one. She was like just this size two months after birth and I think that that's what's so hard is that like you compare yourself to other moms.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-also-been-supportive-of-each-other-s-films>They’ve Also Been Supportive Of Each Other’s Films</h2><p>Their second couples’ date turned out to be more special than the first as it was the premiere for Krasinski and Blunt’s A Quiet Place. At the same time, Reynolds also couldn’t stop praising the movie on social media. In a tweet, the Deadpool star revealed, “I’ve seen #AQuietPlace twice in one week. SEE THIS FILM! @johnkrasinski and #EmilyBlunt are my new parents. Congratulations, Ryan.” In response, Krasinski tweeted, “Thank you Son. Your mother and I are so proud.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And even when it looked like the film had the potential to become a massive success, Reynolds attested that Krasinski remained the same humble actor that he had always been. “John certainly isn’t the guy who calls his shots in that way,” Reynolds explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while speaking with The New York Times</a>. “Before A Quiet Place came out, it wasn’t like he was walking around, saying this thing’s going to blow the doors off the industry. He speaks softly about most things.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Lively and Reynolds also attended the premiere of Blunt’s Mary Poppins Returns. In a post, Reynolds even jokingly remarked, “She is brilliant. She must be stopped.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-ve-hung-out-together-whenever-possible>They’ve Hung Out Together Whenever Possible</h2><p>Aside from attending movie premieres, these famous couples have also arranged for more casual get-togethers. In fact, Krasinski, Blunt, and their children were even guests a birthday party for one of Reynolds and Lively’s daughters. During the party, Krasinski admitted that he and Reynolds behaved like kids themselves as they interacted with one of the animals that were entertaining the kids. “There were animals. The kids saw a chinchilla and exploded,” Krasinski recalled during an appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. “And so then all the other animals weren't being played with. And so there was the owl, and Ryan and I went and nuzzled it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake Lively & 9 Other Celebs Who Are Certified Scuba Divers</a></span></p><p>The two actors also stayed with the owl despite the risks. At the party, they asked its handler if the bird could “scratch our eyeballs out.” “And the guy was like, 'Definitely. You should move away. And we were like, 'Ha ha ha ha.' And that was a Saturday.” Krasinski and Reynolds were even brave enough to take a selfie with the owl. “He understood that we were giving off a very loving male energy and he was digging it,” Krasinski jokingly remarked. “We turned into 14-year-old boys.”</p><p>And when the pandemic struck the U.S. and forced everyone to stay home, the two actors remained in touch. And when they did, the men spoke about what mattered most. “We were mostly talking about what it’s like to raise kids in the midst of a pandemic.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=guess-who-s-doing-a-movie-together>Guess Who’s Doing A Movie Together</h2><p>With the two actors being such longtime friends, it only made sense for Reynolds and Krasinski to finally collaborate on a project onscreen. Back in 2019, it was announced that the actors are teaming up for the fantasy comedy Imaginary Friends, which was picked up by Paramount. The studio had apparently landed the project after winning a bidding war that also involved Lionsgate and Sony.</p><p><a href=#>Krasinski is producing, directing, writing, and starring </a>in the movie. Reynolds will co-star with his longtime pal. Imaginary Friends tells the story of a man who can see and speak with other people’s imaginary friends. It is also later discovered that those who have long been forgotten or discarded have already turned to the dark side.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, it is unclear when the two actors would start production on their upcoming movie. However, fans can be sure that Krasinski and Reynolds are already talking behind the scenes.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>How Emily Blunt Really Feels About Marvel Movies</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6q7vHp2SkqpGotq%2B%2FyqJkmqaUYr%2B6rc1mqZ6xnqS5pb%2BMq5ylmaSevK%2B%2Fx6KnaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
