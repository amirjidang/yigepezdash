But that being said, we completely separate the actor from the character he plays here. According to public interviews and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his social media pages</a>,&nbsp;Dylan Minnette&nbsp;is a great guy with a great heart. Any girl would be lucky to date him and any guy would be lucky to be his friend... but let's talk about the character of Clay Jensen he plays on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Reasons Why</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clay Jensen most definitely has good intentions, but he occasionally exhibits signs of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">toxic masculinity</a> and entitlement. He also makes some questionable choices and between season one and season three of 13 Reasons Why, we have 13 questions we'd like to ask.</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-clay-report-tyler-down-for-almost-shooting-up-a-school-dance><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Why Didn't Clay Report Tyler Down For Almost Shooting Up A School Dance?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons-1.jpg><p>Tyler Down showed up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the high school dance</a> with a bag full of weapons and what did Clay Jensen do?

Clay Jensen on the other hand? It took him an entire season to listen to all of the tapes. Obviously, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">show creators from Netflix</a> decided to split up the tapes into separate episodes to create the proper setup of the story, so we do understand why it worked out the way it did.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-judge-hannah-baker-for-sleeping-with-zach><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Why Did Clay Judge Hannah Baker For Sleeping With Zach?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clay Jensen put Hannah Baker on such an unrealistically high pedestal as if she was meant to be some untouched and undefiled flower. Clay judged her beyond words after finding out that she swiped her V-card with Zach. In reality, it was&nbsp;just fine for Hannah Baker to hook up with Zach. She and Zach connected, Zach was always respectful of her, and her choice to become sexually active should not have warranted judgment– from anyone.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-try-victim-blaming-shaming-in-regards-to-the-clubhouse><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Why Did Clay Try Victim Blaming/Shaming In Regards To The Clubhouse?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons.png><p>After seeing photos of girls being taken advantage of in the clubhouse controlled by the football players, Clay Jensen had the audacity to ask why girls get themselves into these types of predicaments. Sheri shut him down real quick when she said, "Clay, you don't know what was happening in this photo and you don't know what happened after. Girls don't get themselves into bad situations. Guys make the situations bad. You don't know what that feels like, to be a girl in that room."

He got pissed off at her for finding out that she was hooking up with Bryce. It is as if he thought that Ani belonged to him or something. Dear, Clay... Ani was never your property.</p><h2 id=why-does-clay-allow-his-obsession-with-hannah-to-get-so-unhealthy><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Why Does Clay Allow His Obsession With Hannah To Get So Unhealthy?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah-1.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clay's obsession with Hannah Baker got so unhealthy that he was hallucinating her presence well after her death. His obsession clearly was not healthy in the slightest because it is not normal to have daydreams, fantasies, or hallucinations of another person as vivid as the ones that Clay was having of Hannah Baker.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-keep-calling-skye-when-she-asked-him-to-lose-contact><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Why Did Clay Keep Calling Skye When She Asked Him To Lose Contact?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/skye-and-clay.jpeg><p>When Skye and Clay broke things off, Skye did the normal thing and told him not to contact her anymore. She wanted to let it go and move on so that she would be able to start the healing process. Instead of respecting Skye's wishes, Clay blew her phone all the way up. He called her over and over.

She was fearful of having to talk about what she went through in a courtroom full of people who she knew would judge her and assume she was lying.

Now granted, the illegal substance that Clay tried with Hannah was nowhere near as serious as the illegal substances Justin Foley was hooked on... but still! Be understanding, Clay. Justin did not want to get hooked on drugs and ruin his life forever.</p><h2 id=why-didn-t-clay-contact-hannah-s-parents-sooner><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Why Didn't Clay Contact Hannah's Parents Sooner?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/13reasons2.jpeg><p>As soon as Clay Jensen was made aware of the tapes, the first thing he should have done was go straight to Hannah's parents (or the police) with every single one of them. This same statement goes to every person on the list who heard the tapes before Clay did.

He needs the help of a therapist right away after everything he has been through. He went through grief and mourning after losing Hannah, the end of his relationship with Skye, the rejection of Ani, the process of listening to those tapes, the process of trying to take Bryce down in court, and worst of all... the feeling of guilt weighing on his shoulders for Hannah's death.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-try-to-make-hannah-into-someone-she-s-not><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Why Did Clay Try To Make Hannah Into Someone She's Not?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/hannah-clay.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is one of the biggest questions we have. Why did Clay try to make Hannah Baker into someone she wasn't? She was a normal teenage girl, wanting to make new friends and date a good guy during her high school years. Instead of getting that she received nothing but betrayal, bullying, and ostracization.</p><h2 id=why-did-clay-go-along-with-a-fabricated-story-about-bryce-s-murder><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Why Did Clay Go Along With A Fabricated Story About Bryce's Murder?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/funeral.jpg><p>Ani led the way in creating a fabricated story about Bryce Walker's death, blaming the entire thing on Monty. The way it all perfectly wrapped up worked out in Alex Standall's favor because Alex is actually the one who killed him. Our question is, why did Clay go along with that when he is always so uppity about truth, honesty, integrity, etc. Sometimes he cares about being noble, moralistic, and upright... and other times he doesn't?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">13 Reasons Why: Ranking The Most Intense Moments From Season 1 To 3</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiapZmpYn50edGemKynnqh6uLTYZqiunaOptrC60mg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
