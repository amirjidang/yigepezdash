However, given her silence, there has been a bit of backlash cast her way.</p><p>Outside the Masterson scandal, Prepon has been living the mom life and she reprised her role of Donna Pinciotti on 'That '90s Show'.</p><p>Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis are also under fire for throwing their support behind Masterson by providing letters of character for him during his trial.
