That was because Brandi was totally entertaining, and there was always something interesting happening to her and her partner, Jarrod. It was a blast seeing her negotiate and haggle, not only with other people but also her husband. She was never one to back down, and as the show went on, we got to know this woman quite well. Her personality was sassy and full of attitude, and it was sad to see her go. It helped that she was always well-dressed and looked great.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was clear to get a sense of her personality just by looking at her, and how she dressed. This woman definitely had a great sense of fashion for a reality TV star. She knows how to make herself look her absolute best. Sometimes we weren't sure if we were looking at a famous movie star, or someone who ran a couple thrift shops for a living. Sometimes her outfits were very well-received by male viewers, but all in all her clothes were always stylish and chic, while still remaining comfortable and functional. She's the kind of woman that many female viewers wanted to dress like. But what were some of Brandi's best looks?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=maxi-dress><strong>Maxi Dress</strong></h2><p>Brandi is very active on social media, and she has managed to keep her fans interested even after she stopped appearing on television. She has hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, for example, and she never fails to impress with her fashion sense. In this Instagram pic, she is shown wearing a cute maxi dress that really suits her personality. It's loose, fun, and colorful. On the show she favored tank tops and skirts, but off the set she seems to love maxi dresses, and we can't blame her. These dresses are a great choice for comfort and style, and they never go out of style.</p><p>Speaking about her attitude, she revealed: “This may come as a surprise to some people, but I’m actually a very shy person. I even get anxiety when I have to go out to the store or to the gas station because I’m afraid of people approaching me. I was even shy as a child.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=looking-cool-in-faux-fur><strong>Looking Cool In Faux Fur&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Here's another Instagram pic that might grab your attention, and as you can see her sense of style is definitely out there in this picture. She looks like a total fashion model or rich celebrity in this huge faux fur coat, and she's totally rocking it. Her partner Jarrod looks equally cool in his coat, although his is black. "Cool" is definitely the operative word here, as the couple are in an ice bar! If you've never been to one, this is a bar where everything is made out of ice, and it's all kept at freezing temperatures. So while it might be an interesting experience, it's definitely pretty chilly in there! There's no doubt that this was one of her best looks.</p><p>Although Brandi's style of dress has always been more subtle and down-to-earth, it's awesome to see her in a more "out there" style like this one. She proves with this picture that she can pull of almost any look.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=southern-style><strong>Southern Style&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>This Instagram picture is totally different than the last one, and you can see that she is clearly comfortable in a huge range of different styles. While the last outfit showed off her style of dress in cooler temperatures, this one is clearly something that you would wear when it's hot out. Speaking of hot, that dress is incredibly stylish and alluring, and totally suits Brandi. The pattern is very cute and old-fashioned, but the cut is actually pretty bold. The finishing touch is a cowboy hat, a nod to Brandi's Southern influences. This outfit really shows off her personality, and she shows that she can be traditional and adventurous at the same time. This is no easy feat.</p><p>As you can see, this cute couple have matching outfits to some degree here, although Jarrod is a little more understated, wearing just a plaid shirt. But outside of fashion, Jarrod is definitely more of a "loose cannon," with Brandi being the conservative one!</p><h2 id=cute-dress><strong>Cute Dress</strong></h2><p>Throughout her many seasons in reality TV show, Brandi won a huge amount of fans. For many years, Brandi was probably one of the most popular characters on&nbsp;Storage Wars, with some fans getting completely obsessed with her. And it's easy to see why. This girl has everything - charm, wit, and a great sense of humor. She was always an entertaining factor on the show. While not as wild as her partner Jarrod, she was the one who always reeled him in, telling him to play it safe and not be so wild...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A lot of this personality is reflected in her fashion sense. This dress definitely has a lot of character, but it's also pretty cautious and safe. Of course, her curves don't&nbsp;give her any trouble when it comes to making this outfit a little more exciting, and the deep plunging neckline suits her well! But all in all, this was actually a great look for her, and the pattern on the dress is actually very nice.</p><h2 id=sheer-shirt><strong>Sheer Shirt&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Brandi was always a leader on&nbsp;Storage Wars, and the producers knew that she was the type of girl that would grab viewers' attention. That's why they spent a lot of time focusing on Brandi, and she was one of the characters with the most screen time. And the fans loved it! Her sassy attitude and strength made for quite a few interesting situations, and she was forever negotiating with her husband on what the next smartest move was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is definitely one of her more daring looks, but she totally pulls it off. The top is obviously quite sheer, and provides a little spice to the outfit. Was she the one who decided to wear this, or was it the production team that told her to put in on in order to get more views? Either way, it was a great choice, and definitely reminds us of something <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> or a similar celebrity would wear.</p><h2 id=stylish-dress><strong>Stylish Dress</strong></h2><p>As time went on, Brandi got more and more refined when it came to her fashion sense. There was definitely the suggestion that the couple were becoming more and more successful. She started dressing more like a successful businesswoman, and the results were actually quite nice. This dress looks incredibly refined and stylish, and the addition of her necklace and oversized shades really top off the look. Accessories are very important, and with this look Brandi shows that she really understands this rule of fashion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But despite her affluent appearance, Brandi was never really that financially successful. It was revealed that her thrift store never actually made a profit, even after years of operation. So this "rich businesswoman" appearance was all just a ruse. Still, she really nailed it, and convinced a lot of viewers that she was making a lot of money!</p><h2 id=casual-work-attire><strong>Casual Work Attire</strong></h2><p>This look is by far the most recognizable look from Brandi. This is the kind of outfit she wore for most of the episodes, and it really sums up her personality nicely. These kinds of outfits really won her a ton of fans, and definitely piqued the interest of many male viewers. Although this tank top and skirt combo was not overly revealing, it was enough to entice more than a few viewers, and you can see that the outfit looks amazing on her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It would be a crime not to include a look like this in an article of her best looks. After all, it's the look that really epitomizes her character, more than any other outfit. She doesn't look like she's trying too hard, and perhaps that's why this look is so successful. The skirt and tank top are both items of clothing that seem like comfortable and logical choices for her line of work, where she is on her feet and active for most of the day.</p><h2 id=nice-use-of-stripes><strong>Nice Use Of Stripes</strong></h2><p>This look isn't much different from the last one, but it's a fresh take on her signature outfit that ended up looking amazing. A slightly less revealing top matched with a cute blue skirt was her choice for this particular episode, and she topped off the look with some nice shades and that same necklace we saw earlier. Stripes are always a good option when it comes to fashion, especially when you've got curves like Brandi in the chest region. They are very flattering, and it's no wonder why so many viewers were left wondering if Brandi got implants done when this episode aired.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But she's seen a few shocks of her own during her time, as she reveals: "Along the way, we’ve found quite a few: “Star Wars” figures, a samurai helmet, bird boxes, the horse head. It was quite shocking that these things were worth a lot of money."</p><h2 id=gorgeous-lace-dress><strong>Gorgeous Lace Dress</strong></h2><p>Perhaps one of Brandi's most stylish looks was this amazing lace dress. It looks incredible on Brandi, and adds a whole new element of class and elegance. These dresses are very popular with celebrities these days, and they show off the perfect amount of allure and seduction. Brandi might be more comfortable in just a tank top and a simple skirt, but with this look she shows us that she can look like a movie star too when she wants to.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pictures like this got people seriously obsessed with this girl, and some guys actually took it way too far. One man was actually sued by Brandi after he posted a fake tape on a website, claiming that it was really her featured in the video. She sued the man, and actually won... But the judge only awarded her a grand total of $750 instead of the $2.5 million she was asking for. At the end of the day, she just didn't provide enough evidence.</p><h2 id=tight-and-colorful><strong>Tight And Colorful&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Brandi has a really bright personality, and that's a big reason why so many viewers were so drawn to her. She really has a great presence in front of the camera, and she doesn't actually need any help from her fashion sense to get people's attention. However, she does really know how to dress. This incredible bright,&nbsp;fitted dress matches her personality perfectly, and it really extenuates that bubbly persona we all know and love. It's definitely one of her best looks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With all that energy, it's easy to forget that Brandi is also a full-time mom! Speaking about raising her kids, she admitted, “If there’s a formula, I haven’t figured it out yet! Now we can afford to hire some help. I work all the time, so I need someone to assist with the day-to-day stuff, but I do try to make time for the kids. In fact, we are going to Universal Studios in a few days. Oh – also, I rely heavily on caffeine to make it through the day!”</p><h2 id=summer-dress-look><strong>Summer Dress Look</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, the simple things in fashion are the best. People can go way too far when it comes to dressing up, and usually some of the most powerful looks are the subtle, understated ones. A classic look such as a summer dress can be much more interesting and alluring than an expensive designer piece worth thousands of dollars. There's just a certain happiness and vibrancy to such a simple, yet stylish look.</p><p>And with Brandi wearing this incredibly attractive summer dress, nothing can go wrong. Her body is already bursting with feminine energy, and this summer dress is the perfect way to compliment that light, bubbly personality. There's a very simple pattern on it, and Brandi suits the dress perfectly. In addition, it's probably a great choice for working hard in hotter climates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=comfortable-yet-stylish><strong>Comfortable Yet Stylish</strong></h2><p>Above all else, Brandi showed that she is a powerful, independent woman during her time on television. Even though she was part of a team with her partner Jarrod, it never seemed like she was taking orders from him, and she always made her opinions be heard. This look perfectly sums up that outlook on like. The bold, colorful striped skirt says that she's not hiding from anyone, while the black tank top says that she's not afraid to work hard and get her hands dirty.</p><p>That independence and strength must have been very useful when raising kids, and she admits that she's a better mom because of it: “I think I’m a better parent because I work. I used to be a stay-at-home mom and it was very difficult for me. I love my kids, but I felt alienated and depressed when I didn’t have a career, so I think I’m a better parent because I work. I’m happier because of it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=plain-white-tee><strong>Plain White Tee</strong></h2><p>Sometimes, there's nothing better than a plain white tee in terms of fashion. That style will probably never go out of style, and today we're seeing a lot more of plain, solid colors rather than fancy logos or motifs. There's something very mature about this look, and even though it's not over-the-top, it shows that you at least have some fashion sense. Granted, Brandi probably wasn't thinking too hard about her outfit when she went to work that morning, but she still nailed this look.</p><p>Other than her fashion sense, Brandi does have an amazing body. Speaking about her workout regime, she explained: “I used to do Pilates all the time. I’d wake up at 5 am, but then I’d be up late doing things around like house like laundry and then I’d be exhausted. I try to keep my weight down, because the television makes you look heavier. A complete stranger told me last night that I looked bigger on television than I did in person, but I didn’t take it as a compliment!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wedding-dress><strong>Wedding Dress</strong></h2><p>One of the central themes in Storage Wars is not just the business operations of the people involved, but the relationships that develop between them. After all, it's much more interesting that way, and viewers see arguments and drama between people as the main event, rather than certain items selling for exorbitant amounts of money. In terms of Brandi, the main subplot in her story was her relationship with her partner, Jarrod. Most fans know that the two never actually got married on the show. Jarrod proposed, but the marriage was never shown, and we can only assume the two still are yet to be wed!</p><p>In one of the episodes of Brandi And Jarrod: Married To The Job, Brandi is seen modelling a wedding dress, and we have to admit, this is one of her best looks. She looks incredible in this gorgeous dress... We only wish we got to see her wear it on her big day!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beautiful-cotton-dress><strong>Beautiful Cotton Dress</strong></h2><p>Work can be exhausting, especially a line of work like Brandi's. That's why it's so important to mix fashion with function. You don't want to be wearing something that is going to be uncomfortable. But at the same time, you don't want to look unstylish. Brandi shows us all that you can have both style and comfort with this gorgeous grey cotton dress. Just looking at it makes you feel comfortable, and it must have been a great choice for stressful days. But it also is deceptively fashionable, with its simplicity being its main attractive quality.</p><p>And after a hard day, what does Brandi like to do to relax? "I love to cook! I’m Sicilian, so it is in my blood! But it is time-consuming, so I have learned how to cut corners. I rely on roasted chickens a lot – I use them to make things like soups and pot pies. They make it possible for me to get dinner on the table in 30 minutes."</p><p>Sources: starcasm.net</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ks27Ax55km52jqXqnrdKhoKimXZa7pXnBnpiurKliubC7yqxkqJ5dl7%2BiusOiZJ%2Bqn6J6tMDOq5ignV2srrO%2Fjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
