"That's how I think of it. It's nice to see people smile. "Every once in a while, you'll have those moments when people give you the stink eye," she says.

Adds the actress (who headlines the drama, My Sister's Keeper, out June 26): "I don't have any problem with being famous. I've completely made peace with being recognizable and people wanting to peek into my life in some way."</p><p>Unlike the <strong>Mileys</strong> and the <strong>Britneys</strong>, Diaz, a former model, says she is thankful she had to struggle a bit before achieving fame.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Check out what Cameron Diaz used to look like.</p><p>"I had the good fortune of becoming famous once I had already lived a life, traveled a lot, stood in line, had to ask people to help me, had to find a way to make something work, pay the rent, scrape by," she tells the magazine. "I used to do $4 a day with a girlfriend.
