He has received multiple accolades, including a BAFTA Award, and nominations for two Academy Awards, three Golden Globe Awards, nine Primetime Emmy Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards Mark Wahlberg’s sprawling Richard Landry-designed estate in the desirable Beverly Park neighborhood has popped up for sale again, this time with freshly staged interiors, updated listing photos, a new agent and substantially reduced $79.5 million ask.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b> </b><b>A Peek Inside Mark Wahlberg's Multi-Million-Dollar Watch Collection</b></a></span></p><p>That’s a whopping $8 million less than the Hollywood actor/producer originally wanted. But if the place trades for near that amount, it still will be the most expensive property ever sold in the ultra-exclusive gated community — topping the recent $70 million sale of Alec Gores’ bespoke showpiece and Adele’s $58 million purchase of Sylvester Stallone’s former home.</p><p>Custom-built over several years by Wahlberg and wife Rhea Durham, amid a vacant parcel they purchased for $8.25 million back in 2009, the compound was completed in 2014. Hidden away behind gates and protected by an elaborate security system, the property includes a château-inspired main mansion and additional structures spread across a 6-acre parcel of land — for a total of 12 bedrooms and 20 baths in over 30,000 square feet, all of it boasting glitzy amenities ranging from a movie theater and mirrored gym, to a wine cellar with tasting room, according to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i>.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Inside the primary residence, a grand double-height foyer clad in limestone and displaying a bridal staircase greets and flows to multi-level living space highlighted by formal living and dining rooms, along with a soaring wood-paneled library. A family room connects to a gourmet kitchen outfitted with two islands, and there’s also an opulent master retreat sporting a fireside sitting area, private balcony, and dual closets and baths.</p><p>Rounding it all out: resort-inspired grounds showcased by manicured gardens, a five-hole golf course and driving range, tennis court with viewing platform, grotto-style pool with waterfalls, skate park and detached guesthouse. The new owner also will be required to pay HOA dues costing an eye-popping $3,000 per month.</p><p>In addition to Wahlberg’s for-sale Beverly Park mansion, he recently paid upwards of $30 million for 2.5 acres of land and a separate bungalow inside the guard-gated Summit Club community near Las Vegas.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carl Gambino of Compass and Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency hold the listing, which is being shown only to prequalified clients.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>: </b></a><a href=#><b>F.
