Sheryl Crow's love life has always been a topic of interest, while Lance Armstrong's career took a hit following his doping controversy. It seems like negativity has followed the popular athlete since, and that held true for his performance on SNL. In the following, we're going to turn the calendar back to the early 2000s and take a closer look at Lance's three-year relationship with Crow. <a href=../../sheryl-crows-relationship-with-lance-armstrong-was-a-low-point-of-her-life.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../shyne-diddy-1999-club-new-york-shooting-trial-1234642660.html>Shyne On Diddy And 1999 Club New York Shooting Trial: &amp;quot;I Forgave Him&amp;quot;</a></h2><div class=meta><span class=key>published on</span>

While he's breaking out the buds for his buds, count on one of his dopest pals, Snoop Dogg, to be checking out the octagon carnage and the after-party, according to TMZ. <a href=../../sean-omalley-snoop-dogg-marijuana.html>Read More...</a></section></article></div><nav class=paginator><a class=nav-left href=../../page/397/index.html>&lt; Prev</a>
