Over the recent years, firms like Hipgnosis Songs Fund, Primary Wave, and Litmus Music (a catalog rights company backed by private-equity firm Carlyle Group LP) have risen to buy artists’ back catalogs, paying out millions (and in the case of artists like <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Justin Bieber</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Bruce Springsteen</a></strong>, hundreds of millions) to artists and labels to own the rights to their classic songs.</p><p>After securing the rights, these companies get all the money from royalties, licensing, brand deals and other revenue streams that would generally go to the artists, per <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>.</p><p>Why would artists sell the rights to the music they’ve worked so hard to make? There are many reasons. First off, there’s a tax benefit: doing a one-time multimillion-dollar payout with a 20 percent tax is much more appealing than facing an annual tax rate as high as 37 percent.</p><p>It might also be worth more for an artist to take the multimillion-dollar buyout due to the modern music landscape. Streaming pays less than actual album sales used to, so to make money, an artist needs to tour. Unless you’re <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a> or <a href=#><strong>Beyoncé</strong></a>, even touring doesn’t make as much money as it once did.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The move isn’t just for older legends securing a retirement fund for their golden years. Bieber sold his catalog for $200 million in 2023, ensuring that he will get that $200 million in his lifetime instead of holding onto the rights in the hope of accruing that money through licensing deals and royalties.</p><p>Scroll down for a list of major music stars who have sold their catalogs:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BgrrXFjKmcq6qpYre2v9OipWaamZqvpr6Mm6mum5ViwLG%2ByKeerKyVmrturc2dZKanopp6or7Toqqtq12stbB50qijnWWknbKqvoymrKyhk2KwosDApaagq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
