It's about the demands she makes, how she treats other people, and her egotistical opinion of herself. Well, reportedly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a> makes outrageous demands, treats most people like dirt, and thinks she is the greatest singer and actress in the world.</p><p>Now, that means that her staff has it tough. And pity anybody like a maid or airline attendant that comes within her orbit. And her fellow co-stars? She spends most of her time dissing them personally and professionally. And, trust us, they return the compliment, saying she is difficult, if not impossible to work with. And we haven't even gotten to the diva demands yet.</p><p>Let's have a look at why no one wants to work with or for Jenny from the Block, a.k.a. the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">still hot Jennifer Lopez</a></p><h2 id=the-servant-class>The Servant Class</h2><p>Whether you are a member of her staff, a workman at her house, an airline attendant, or a maid, JLo is going to ignore you.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Workmen at her house have complained that she won't even acknowledge them or look them in the eye. It's as if they are not there.</p><p>Take the United Airlines First Class airline attendant who merely asked JLo what she would like to drink.</p><p>"I just said, 'What can I get you to drink?' But Jennifer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">refused to even acknowledge me. </a>She turned her head away and told her personal assistant, 'Please tell him I'd like a Diet Coke and lime.' " JLo refused to even look at him. The assistant did as she was told.</p><p>It gets a lot worse when you look at the German hotel maid who dared to knock on Jennifer's door and politely ask for an autograph.</p><p>Pray Dodaj, a maid at a luxury hotel in Dusseldorf was a big fan of Jenny from the Block.</p><p>She said: "I am an incredibly big fan so I took all my courage and rang the bell to get an autograph, but I was rejected by two assistants at the door. "</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued: "A day later the cleaning company that employed me . . . called and said that Ms. Lopez had complained. I was fired right there on the phone."</p><p>Apparently, the humble act in 2002's&nbsp;Maid in Manhatten&nbsp;wasn't for real!</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What It's Like To Work For Jennifer Lopez</a></span></p><p>Want to be on her staff? Be prepared to be on call 24/7 to cater to her every whim and need. And, unless you are one or two of the staff who are very senior, don't even expect her to acknowledge you. One staff member said it was like working for a ghost.</p><h2 id=her-co-stars-are-routinely-dissed-and-clap-back>Her Co-Stars Are Routinely Dissed (And Clap Back)</h2><p>JLo has gone on record saying she is a great actress. Some would disagree.</p><p>So, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">what does she think of Cameron Diaz? </a>Jennifer dismissed her saying she was: "A lucky model who's been given a lot of opportunities. I just wish she would have done more with them."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cameron, in turn, has commented on JLo's behavior on the set of 2012's&nbsp;What to Expect When You're Expecting.&nbsp;JLo pretty much ignored Diaz. For her part, Cameron has said that the huge entourage Jennifer insists on bringing along and her tendency to do things like stop in the middle of a scene if she has a meal break scheduled made her difficult, if not impossible, to work with her. She said Lopez should stick to singing, referring to it as her "day job". Ouch.</p><p>Now, whatever you think about Gwyneth Paltrow, she is generally considered to be a fine actress. Jennifer's opinion is "Gwyneth who?"</p><p>Lopez was scathing when she said: "Tell me what she's been in? I swear to God I don't remember anything she was in. . . I heard more about her and Brad Pitt than I ever heard about her work." Talk about elitist. Being rich and famous has gone straight to Lopez's head.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's How Jennifer Lopez Spends Her $400 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=those-diva-demands>Those Diva Demands</h2><p>Where do we begin? Let's take the Indian Premier League Twenty20 cricket tournament in 2013. Lopez was supposed to appear alongside rapper Pitbull. But when she demanded a private plane and countless hotel rooms for her staff, the organizers said no way. And JLo was out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lopez Is Totally Overrated, According To Howard Stern&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>The cricket thing was bad enough. But the demands she made to appear at the World Music Awards in 2010 are in a class of their own.&nbsp;The Mirror&nbsp;reported that JLo's demands included having a helicopter kept on stand-by, as well a "custom-fitted speed boat" and (wait for it) "a pair of diamond-encrusted headphones to drown out the sound of the boat's motor . . ." And she wasn't finished, demanding that she be given an entire floor of the hotel.</p><p>We could go on and on. But you probably get the drift. Nobody, but nobody wants to work with or for Jennifer Lopez. We hear even A-Rod is afraid of her!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Does Jennifer Lopez Keep Delaying Her Wedding To Alex Rodriguez?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdo7yju8OyZLCZnqnAbsDOZq6oqptixKrAx2ahnqaenrOmvoylpqmdqmQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
