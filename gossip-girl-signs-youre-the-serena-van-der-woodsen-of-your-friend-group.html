There are so many reasons to love a character like Serena and so many reasons to want to be just like her! <a href=#>Comparing Serena to&nbsp;Blair</a>&nbsp;is a super common thing but truthfully, most people would rather be the Serena of their social circle since she seems to be so playful and fun!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gossip Girl: Here Are Serena And Blair's Relationships, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><p class=p1>Serena was played by one of the loveliest the most talented actresses ever, Blake Lively. In real life, Blake Lively isn’t really much like the character she played on <a href=#>Gossip Girl</a> but she added a face to the awesome character&nbsp;bringing the&nbsp;persona of Serena to life! <a href=#>The rest of the cast</a> was just as amazing in the show. Are you the “Serena” of your friend group?</p><h2 id=you-aren-t-ever-single-for-too-long><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>You Aren’t Ever Single For Too Long</span></h2><p class=p1>Relationships come and go in your life super easy-- if you are like Serena! Serena was never single for too long. She bounced around from dating <a href=#>Dan Humphrey</a> to Carter Baizen to Aaron Rose to Gabriel Edwards to Tripp van der Bilt to Nate Archibald to Collin Forrester to Ben Donovan to Max Harding to Steven Spence... And ultimately, she ended up marrying Dan Humphrey even though some&nbsp;<a href=#>fans felt like Chuck and Blair were the better couple</a>. People who can relate to Serena don’t stay single for very long.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-knew-your-whole-life-that-college-wasn-t-for-you><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>You Knew Your Whole Life That College Wasn’t For You</span></h2><p class=p1>Serena knew that college was not the right thing for her in her life after she pretended she was getting ready to go to Brown University and didn’t actually end up going. Serena ended up moving to Los Angeles to pursue an internship rather than following her original plan to attend college. She wanted to be a free bird, enjoying different experiences in life. She knew college was just going to weigh her down. If you’re anything like her, you probably knew pretty early on that college wasn’t right for you. College simply isn’t for everyone!</p><h2 id=you-went-through-a-hardcore-partying-phase><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>You Went Through A Hardcore Partying Phase</span></h2><p class=p1>If you’re the Serena of your friend group, then you probably went through a hardcore partying phase at some point in your life. Serena’s partying phase happened when she was still a high school student. By the time she reached her young adult years (18 to 25), she was legally allowed to do more things but she wasn’t even interested in partying anymore. She had a really wild phase before she got shipped off to boarding school... but her party phase was probably way more intense than the average person’s. She hooked up with a lot of people she shouldn’t have, used illegal substances, and made (one too many) very serious mistakes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=your-relationship-with-your-mom-is-more-like-a-friendship><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Your Relationship With Your Mom Is More Like A Friendship</span></h2><p class=p1>Serena’s relationship with her mom comes across as more of a friendship than anything else. Her mom doesn’t really do too much disciplining and because of that, Serena feels comfortable and free to be herself and do whatever she wants to do.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>If You Miss Gossip Girl, Watch These Shows Instead</a></span></p><p class=p1>Fortunately for her mother, Lily, Serena wasn’t too rebellious of a teenager upon returning from boarding school. If you feel like your relationship with your mom is more like a friendship than a typical mother-daughter dynamic, then you can relate to Serena.</p><h2 id=people-have-told-you-to-become-a-model><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>People Have Told You To Become A Model</span></h2><p class=p1>Have people ever told you that you should become a model? Do they compliment your attractive looks often? Do you people remind you how pretty you are on a daily basis? If that’s the case then you definitely might be the Serena of your social circle! She is a tall, beautiful bombshell who even beat out her best friend, <a href=#>Blair Waldorf</a> for a modeling campaign with Eleanor Waldorf in the first season of the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-know-you-re-a-little-rebellious><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>You Know You’re A Little Rebellious</span></h2><p class=p1>Do you consider yourself to be a little more on the rebellious side? Do you make different&nbsp;decisions than the rest of the people in your friend group? If so, then you most likely are just like Serena! She doesn’t like to conform.</p><p class=p1><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Ranking Gossip Girl’s Most Messed Up Villains</a></span></p><p class=p1>She doesn’t like to fit into any mold. She stands out and she loves that about herself. Anyone who is comfortable and confident enough in their skin to do their own thing, regardless of what a crowd of people chooses to do, is a leader just like Serena.</p><h2 id=you-treat-your-friends-like-family><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>You Treat Your Friends Like Family</span></h2><p class=p1>Serena always treated her closest friends like they were her family members so if that’s something that you do too, then you and Serena definitely have that in common. One major example is Serena’s relationship with Jenny Humphrey (<a href=#>played by Taylor Momsen</a>.) She treated Jenny like a little sister! When her mother and Chuck Bass's father got married, she treated Chuck like a brother. She pretty much forgave Chuck for trying to aggressively kiss her in the first season and grew close enough to him that they had a brother-sister relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-re-constantly-the-subject-of-rumors><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>You’re Constantly The Subject Of Rumors</span></h2><p class=p1>Do you feel like you’re constantly the subject of rumors? When other people like to gossip about you, it just means that they are interested in you and enjoy talking about you because either they are intrigued by you or they are jealous of you. There is something super cool about you because it makes other people feel the need to open up their mouths and talk about you all the time! Serena was constantly the subject of rumors and gossip and she simply took it all in stride.</p><h2 id=it-seems-effortless-for-you-to-be-so-fabulous><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>It Seems Effortless For You To Be So Fabulous</span></h2><p class=p1></p><p class=p1>For Serena, it never seemed like she tried too hard to be fabulous. She never overdid it with her makeup yet she always looked completely flawless. Even when she was in high school wearing her school uniform every day, she was stunning. Is that the case for you as well? Some people look amazing without any effort at all. They can go to the gym or the grocery store and still look as if they are absolutely glowing. Other people need a little bit of extra help to look great when they walk out the door. Serena is the type of person who was effortlessly fabulous!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=you-thrive-when-you-re-the-center-of-attention><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>You Thrive When You’re The Center Of Attention</span></h2><p class=p1>For Serena van der Woodsen, it seemed like attention was always on her. Everywhere she went, curious eyes followed. Everyone wanted to know what was going on with Serena! If you are the type of person who thrives well when all of the attention is on you, then you are definitely the Serena of your friend group. Some people hate being the&nbsp;center&nbsp;of attention but if you are comfortable with it, then you’re just like Serena.</p><p class=p1><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Gossip Girl Is Getting A Reboot: Here’s What We Know So Far</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGieqKujnr1us8iro2armZy7tHnYqKyrnV2ptaZ50p6pnqaRYsOiuoydnKtlp6S8pb%2FEp2Sonl2uvLa%2BjJ%2Bpop2emXqovs6up2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
