What the public knows about them is what Johansson allows them to know. Something that Romain Dauriac, Johansson's second husband, agrees with. <a href=#>The agreement to keep Rose out of the spotlight helped Johansson and Dauriac co-parent so amicably</a>. Colin Jost, Johansson's third husband and father of her son, Cosmo, agrees with raising the kids this way as well.</p><p>Because of this, Johansson is doing her best to ensure that her kids grow up with as normal a childhood as possible. This, despite the fact that their parents, to one degree or another, are in the public eye. For the longest time, Rose did not really know what Johansson did for work. She made up stories about Johansson's profession instead.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/your-paragraph-text-2024-01-28t141749-988.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Praised This Late Night Host For "Effortlessly" Flirting With Scarlett Johansson While Questioning Her Failed Marriage</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Scarlett Johansson was turning red during her "flirty" late night interview.</span><p>While Scarlett Johansson's kids may not understand her job, they are very involved with her work. This comes down to the roles she takes, how long she will allow herself to stay away from home, and even what previous films Johansson shows her children — all of which Rose and Cosmo have opinions about.</p><h2 id=who-are-scarlett-johansson-39-s-kids-rose-and-cosmo>Who Are Scarlett Johansson's Kids Rose And Cosmo?</h2><h3 id=scarlett-johansson-39-s-children-are-rose-dauriac-and-cosmo-jost>Scarlett Johansson's children are Rose Dauriac and Cosmo Jost</h3><p>Johansson has two children. Her first child is her daughter, who she welcomed with her then-husband, Romain Dauriac, who Johansson was married to for three years. Johansson's second child is her son, who she shares with husband Colin Jost.</p><p>Johansson and Jost have been married since 2020. Johansson's first marriage to <strong><a href=#>Ryan Reynolds</a></strong> did not produce any children. However, <a href=#>the end of Reynolds and Johansson's relationship did end with an amicable divorce, despite a lack of prenup being signed</a>.</p><h3 id=rose-dorothy-dauriac>Rose Dorothy Dauriac</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose was born in August 2014</a>. The middle name that was given to Rose was in tribute to Johansson's grandmother, who Johansson called the "first Francophone in [her] family."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to a publicist, both Johansson and Rose were doing well after delivery.</p><p>While Johansson has done quite a bit to keep Rose out of the spotlight, she did share some details about her daughter as she was growing up, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including the fact that Rose was very girly</a>. So girly, in fact, that princess dresses were being washed constantly as a result of wearing them out in New York City constantly.</p><p>She's very, very, very girly, Johansson explained. "Like painfully girly. I thought I was girly but she is-- she wants to wear the princess dress to bed. And she wants to wear it to school. And it's like, filthy. And New York is not the best place to have fabric dragging around behind you. But, yeah. She's just a princess-obsessed little girl."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/who-is-scarlett-johansson-s-daughter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The sense of fashion Rose had when she was three did not change when she turned seven. But instead of questioning what she was wearing, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rose questioned Johansson's fashion choices</a>, specifically when it came to her undergarments.</p><p>"She asked me why my underwear went up my butt crack, and I had to try to explain what a panty line was. I was like, 'cause you don’t want a line in your pants,' and she was like 'Why?'" Johansson said. "And I was like, 'cause you could see my underwear.'"</p><p>Johansson went on to say, "She was like 'But you are wearing underwear.' Like I know, it’s weird."</p><h3 id=cosmo-jost>Cosmo Jost</h3><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cosmo Jost was born in August 2021</a>. The birth was announced via social media when Jost posted, "Ok ok we had a baby. His name is Cosmo. We love him very much."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the name made some people scratch their heads, it was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">intentional so that Cosmo and Rose had a commonality between their names</a>.</p><p>"Cosmo is a really sweet little flower that comes in different shades of orange and yellow," Johansson explained. "That's why my daughter liked it too."</p><p>While she has not spoken much about Cosmo, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johansson did open up about his terrible twos</a>. Something that was not too bad to deal with until Jost returned to <strong><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a></strong> after the writer's strike ended.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/your-paragraph-text-2023-12-23t182005-337.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Asking Scarlett Johansson A Fashion Question While She's With Her Her Avengers Co-Stars Is Not A Good idea</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>While promoting Avengers: Infinity War, Scarlett Johansson was caught by surprise over the question she was asked, and had quite the reaction.</span><p>"I think the ‘Terrible Twos’ are more like tackling me!" Johansson said about dealing with Jost's absence in the house. "Like, actually physically tackling me."</p><p>But other than the normal tantrums of toddlers, it sounds like all is well with Johansson's children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-scarlett-johansson-39-s-kids-think-about-her-movies>What Scarlett Johansson's Kids Think About Her Movies</h2><h3 id=scarlett-johansson-39-s-kids-gave-her-a-lukewarm-reaction-to-the-films-they-have-been-allowed-to-see>Scarlett Johansson's kids gave her a lukewarm reaction to the films they have been allowed to see</h3><p>When it comes to Johansson's films, a number of them are not appropriate yet for her kids to see. However, there was one that they came across unintentionally as trilogies were being watched. <a href=#>The film that Johansson starred in was </a><a href=#>Home Alone 3</a>. When Home Alone 3 came on and she was on screen, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johansson thought there would be some excitement from her kids</a>, but a lukewarm reaction was all that Johansson received instead.</p><p>"I guess it wasn't intentional. We went through the series—we did Indiana Jones. Then we watched Back to the Future. And then, of course, naturally we did Home Alone," Johansson explained. "And I happened to be in the third Home Alone movie, and so I didn't say anything to her because I thought she would make a big deal out of it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/scarlett-johansson-at-the-76th-cannes-film-festival-for-the-premiere-of-asteroid-city.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Johansson went on to say, "Not surprisingly, she didn't pick up on it right away. I had to really, like—'See who that is?' She's like, 'Whatever. Is that you?' I was like, 'It's me, your momma.' And she was like, 'Oh, OK. Whatever.'"</p><p>This was a bit of a change from when Johansson's daughter was younger and was excited about the fact that Johansson was a superhero. All of which came about from the long shoot on Infinity War.</p><p>"If you ask her what I do for a living, she says, ‘Mommy’s a superhero,'" Johansson, said during her interview with Ellen DeGeneres. "We had taken a break in shooting Infinity War because it was an extremely long shoot. I was going into the office — I was not doing anything film related, I was like, 'See you later, honey, Mommy has to go to work.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/scarlett-johansson-s-kiss-with-matt-damon-in-we-bought-a-zoo-was-a-nightmare-behind-the-scenes-front-deposit-back-fox-family-entertainment_youtube.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Scarlett Johansson's Kiss With Matt Damon In We Bought A Zoo Was A Nightmare Behind The Scenes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Both Scarlett Johansson and Matt Damon were caught off-guard by their intimate scene in We Bought a Zoo.</span><p>Johansson went on to explain, "And she was like, 'Who are you fighting?'

If anybody has a regular uniform that they normally wear to work, mine’s a pleather unitard."</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson-calls-being-a-mom-like-being-in-an-quot-emotionally-abusive-relationship-quot>Scarlett Johansson Calls Being A Mom Like Being In An "Emotionally Abusive Relationship"</h2><h3 id=scarlett-johansson-is-like-all-moms-who-believe-motherhood-is-quot-rewarding-quot-but-it-is-an-emotional-roller-coaster-as-well>Scarlett Johansson is like all moms who believe motherhood is "rewarding" but it is an emotional roller coaster as well</h3><p>Johansson is like most moms. While she loves being a mom, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett says that motherhood has its moments where it is incredibly frustrating as well</a>. It is during those times when the emotions run high and to Johansson, it feels like being in a relationship with all give and no take.</p><p>"It’s really tough. I remember my daughter, my daughter was eight-and-a-half, and when she was two, I said, 'This is great. I don't know what everybody is talking about.' And then she turned 3 and it’s like being in an emotionally abusive relationship," Johansson said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/scarlett-johansson.png><p>It’s crazy, like very intense emotional swings and like, so bossy and adamant and like, it's just crazy. And, also these huge mood swings, constant mood swings, which I was like these, 'Those poor little guys.' I feel bad for 'em. You're like up and down constantly," she added.</p><p>She went on to say that when babies are very young, they're much easier to handle, saying, "Having a baby is so lovely. They're so cute. They sit there and they love you and then that's it. And you just get like love from them."</p><p>However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johansson would not change anything about being a mother</a>, calling the experience, "incomparable."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I think being a parent is the hardest, most rewarding … thing you’ll ever do.
