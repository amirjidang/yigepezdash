Four years later, they confirmed their romance after being photographed kissing in a car in July 2021.</p><p>The twosome have kept a relatively low profile throughout their relationship. However, Zendaya has opened up about accepting that “parts of [her] life” are “going to be public” knowledge.</p><p>“I can’t not be a person and live my life and love the person I love. But also, I do have control over what I choose to share,” she told Elle in August 2023. “It’s about protecting the peace and letting things be your own but also not being afraid to exist. You can’t hide. That’s not fun, either. I am navigating it more than ever now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Tom-Holland-Supports-Girlfriend-Zendaya-at-Dune-2-Afterparty-2.jpg><p>Prior to hitting the afterparty with her man on Thursday, Zendaya attended the premiere wearing a metallic robot suit with PVC-covered cutouts on her chest, arms, stomach, thighs and backside. She gave a cheeky view of the back of the Mugler outfit while posing on the red carpet.</p><p>Zendaya was joined at the premiere by other stars from the sci-fi movie including <strong>Timothée Chalamet</strong>, <strong>Austin Butler</strong>, <strong>Florence Pugh</strong> and <strong>Anya Taylor-Joy</strong>.</p><p>While Zendaya and Chalamet, 28, both appeared in the first Dune film, which hit theaters in October 2021, Butler, 32, Pugh, 28, and Taylor-Joy, 27, are new additions. Taylor-Joy’s involvement was confirmed by her attendance on Thursday.</p><p>“This is a dream come true,” Taylor-Joy said during an interview at the premiere, which streamed live on Warner Bros.’ TikTok. “The books are incredible, but with this cast and with [director] <strong>Denis</strong> [<strong>Villeneuve</strong>], it doesn’t get any better than that.”</p><p>Villeneuve, 56, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Weekly </a>on Thursday that “it required so much work” to keep Taylor-Joy’s role a secret.</p><p>“Everybody signed with their blood,” he quipped.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In addition to the new faces, Zendaya will also play a larger part in the sequel than she did in the first film.</p><p>“For Zendaya, I will say Part One was a promise. I know that we saw a glimpse of her in Part One, but in Part Two, she’ll have a prominent part,” Villeneuve told <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a> in March 2022. “We will follow Timothée and Zendaya on their adventures in the desert. That’s the thing that excited me most about going back to Arrakis is to spend time with those characters again.”</p><p>Dune: Part Two hits theaters on March 1.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp51itbC4y5qlnWWjqr2xu9Gtqmafmae5p77InqWdZaqau6Wt2JpkmqxdmcKvsYypmKusXWd6orLTnqmpmaKpxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
