So how much is Mallette worth and how exactly has she amassed her fortune?</p><h2 id=pattie-mallette-s-net-worth>Pattie Mallette’s Net Worth</h2><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, JB’s mother is worth an astounding $20 million, which may surprise a lot of people — or maybe it won’t.</p><p>After all, her 2013 memoir was a huge success, and considering how Bieber was arguably at the peak of his career during this time, anything that had his name attached to it was bound to be a success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez Is Not A Whiz In The Kitchen, But ‘Selena + Chef’ Season 2 Might Change That</a></span></p><p>When signing a book deal, especially with someone who is willing to share a lot of personal details about their life - in Mallette’s case, this included topics <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">such as raising the Biebs while selling drugs to survive</a> - her raw and honest revelations would’ve earned her a lot of money.</p><p>While it’s never been disclosed how much she actually made from the deal, Mallette’s book became a best-seller by the year’s end which, again, didn’t really come as a surprise <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">considering the juicy details she was willing to spill</a>.</p><p>In one excerpt, she discussed how her dad walking out on their family at a young age played a tremendous role in all of the turbulent experiences she would face as a teenager with no father figure to depend on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“When my dad left us, it ripped a hole in my heart—one that began filling with thoughts and feelings that would challenge and ultimately damage my identity and self-worth,” she said. “The wound of being abandoned travels deep and forever changes you.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim Kardashian, Gigi Hadid, & Other Celebs Battling Lifelong Illnesses</a></span></p><p>While she had ambitions to become a stage performer in her younger years, the challenges of raising a boy on her own after calling it quits with Bieber’s dad Jeremy halted those plans.</p><p>Not to mention that with bills beginning to pile up every month, Mallette decided to give up on her dreams to focus her attention on making enough money to provide a comfortable life for her son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bieber started recording covers to popular songs before he’d upload them to YouTube where he’d eventually be discovered by Braun, who decided to give the then-teenager a shot by signing him to a record deal with RBMG Records in 2008.</p><p>Before Braun came into the picture, Bieber had already amassed hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube, and while his popularity is obviously much bigger now than it was back then, the mother of one decided to fulfill the role as her son’s manager when his music career started taking off even before his record deal came about.</p><p>It’s unclear whether her short stint as his manager would’ve made her much money, but it would certainly explain how her net worth has reached $20 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Holland Partners With Russo Brothers Again In New Teaser Trailer For ‘Cherry’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mallette has kept a rather low profile in the past couple of years, but she still partakes in interviews every now and then, which probably earns her a substantial amount given that she’s Bieber’s mom.</p><p>In 2018, Mallette gave a speech on GOD TV, stressing how dedicating her life to faith and religion helped her overcome some of the darkest moments she’s ever had to face in her life including endless suicidal thoughts before her son would rise to stardom and become a global superstar.</p><p>“My spiritual mom and dad were raised up by John and Carol and Arnott and I remember giving my life to Jesus in a hospital room after I had tried to commit suicide,” she said.</p><p>“You taught them to love me where I was at,” Pattie told Carol Arnott. “I remember coming here in 1994 when I was staying at a pregnancy home. I remember the church leaders praying over me and prophesying that I was going to birth revival.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She now spends her time between Los Angeles and Canada, and while she often accompanies Bieber to his sold-out shows, Mallette can sit back and sleep comfortably knowing that the troubles she’s faced in the past are long gone.</p><p>And as far as her former financial struggle is concerned, that’s clearly a thing of the past at this time.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">From ‘Thank U, Next’ To ‘Dangerous Woman’: Ariana Grande’s Biggest Moments In Music History</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dn8K0wMinZJuhlZeys7%2BMpqamZaCWwbW1xGakmqScmsG1sYyapJqro5qxbrTEq2RraF2itq24yKilZqaVqXq4u9Gtn2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
