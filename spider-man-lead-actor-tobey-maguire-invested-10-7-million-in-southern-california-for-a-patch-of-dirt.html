In Brentwood, Tobey Maguire just hauled in $10.75 million for a 1-acre patch of dirt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As stated in <a href=#><i>Los Angeles Times</i></a><i>,</i> an empty acre could fetch such a sum only in a handful of Los Angeles enclaves, and Brentwood is one of them. In a neighborhood chock-full of celebrities and famous estates, the undeveloped plot represents the chance to immediately start building a custom home with plenty of space to spread out.</p><p>Aerial photos show the plot is one of the only empty properties in the neighborhood.</p><p>Tobey Maguire, who starred in Sam Raimi’s “Spider-Man” trilogy, barely pulled off a profit after paying $10 million for the property in 2008. Records show he first tried to sell it for $14.25 million in 2018 before eventually trimming the price down to $11 million last summer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Maguire’s ownership, the property held a Monterey Colonial-style home built by John Byers, the noted architect whose Spanish-influenced builds are scattered across the Westside. Old listing materials note former owners such as actor Jack Oakie, actress Greta Garbo and filmmaker H.C. Potter.</p><p>At $10.75 million, it’s L.A.’s second-priciest land deal in 2021 behind an empty lot in nearby Brentwood Park that traded hands for $11.5 million in January.</p><p>In addition to the three “Spider-Man” films, Maguire boasts a consistent string of credits dating from the ‘90s with notable roles in “The Cider House Rules,” “Seabiscuit” and “The Great Gatsby.” The Santa Monica native received a Golden Globe nomination for his role in 2009’s “Brothers.”</p><p>David Offer of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices California Properties held the listing. Alan Sette represented the buyer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>The OG Spiderman: How Tobey Maguire Made His $75 Million Fortune</b></a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#><i>The Things</i></a>, Tobey Maguire is an actor, but in his downtime, he's also a poker player. Poker is about taking risks, more often than not, with money. That's exactly what he did in 2008 when he decided to buy a plot of land in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California for $10 million.</p><p>Figuring he might do something profitable with it in the future, he held onto it for 10 years before he tried selling it in 2018 for $14.25 million. Clearly he was unsuccessful, and he lowered the price down to $11 million in 2020. Still being unsuccessful in his attempts to turn a profit, he eventually was able to sell the plot of dirt for around $10.7 million the following year, not even making $1 million back in profit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>, Tobey's current house, located in the same neighborhood, is what designers call "modern traditional", with a front facing 3-car garage in a farm-like structure.</p><p>The house boasts 6 bedrooms, 7.5 bathrooms, and an estimated 7,500 square footage. Most of the house has white walls and light colored hardwood floors as well as brand-new appliances in the kitchen. The main bedroom has a beautiful vaulted ceiling and a black marble fireplace (one of two fireplaces in the house), as well as large windows that look down into the backyard. The patch of greenery in the backyard is shielded by a privacy fence made out of tall trees and bushes.</p><p>In a 2014 article as reported by <a href=#><i>Page Six</i></a> detailing Tobey's absurd and petty behavior when he doesn't get his way, he is known to be quite the sore loser, especially when it comes to poker.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Due to his previous behavior, his fans wonder how he felt when he wasn't able to make a discernable profit on the plot of land. Whatever he was feeling, it clearly hasn't stopped him from taking big risks in different business ventures or stop him from continuing to play high-stakes poker with other celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and Ben Affleck. Only time will tell where his poker playing and high risk taking will lead him next.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>‘American Rapper’ Future Allegedly Publishing Millions Worth Of Music Catalog</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TheThings</a>, <a href=#>Dirt</a>, <a href=#>Page Six</a>, <a href=#>Los Angeles Times</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmasqJmZsrN5zJqlZqSVlrFurcKtpqtlpKSvpsWMppigrZmnsm61za%2BcrKyVmXpyfIxwZKahnKG2sLqMoqVmq5%2Bqwamx0adknJmcnrOwvs2imGaen6d6onnPmqucoF2ks26wyKuraA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
