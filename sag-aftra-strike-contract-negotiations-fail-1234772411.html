SAG also seeks transparency from streaming platforms regarding royalties and viewership data in order to make business similar to its network television counterpart.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>During the walkout</a>, actors will not participate in press junkets, conventions, interviews, and even Emmy campaigns — which recently <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>announced their list of nominations.</a>&nbsp;Fran Drescher, president of the actors union and acclaimed actress, spoke during a press conference on Thursday (July 14) about SAG’s decision to <a href=# id=auto-tag_strike data-tag=strike>strike</a>. Drescher called out Hollywood studios for their “greedy” business dealings and the inability to structure a reasonable deal.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher: "How they plead poverty that they are losing money left and right when they give $100 millions to their CEOs."</p><p>“If we don’t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines” <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/zIIsNQjZHa</a></p>— philip lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) <a href=# rel=nofollow>July 13, 2023</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We are the victims here,” Fran said. “We are being victimized by a very greedy entity. I am shocked by the way the people that we have been in business with are treating us… It is disgusting; shame on them. You cannot change the business model as much as it has changed and not expect the contract to change, too.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She continued, “If we don’t stand tall right now, we are all going to be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines and big business.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers responded to the SAG strike, blaming the actor’s union for stalling contract negotiations.&nbsp;“[AMPTP] presented a deal that offered historic pay and residual increases, substantially higher caps on pension and health contributions, audition protections, shortened series option periods, and a groundbreaking AI proposal that protects actors’ digital likenesses.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, national executive director and chief negotiator for <a href=# id=auto-tag_sag-aftra data-tag=sag-aftra>SAG-AFTRA</a>, shot back at AMPTP’s statement, honing in on their “groundbreaking A.I. proposal.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“In that groundbreaking A.I. proposal,” he said. “They proposed that our background performers should be able to be scanned, get paid for one day’s pay, and their company should own that scan, their image, their likeness, and should be able to use it for the rest of eternity in any project they want with no consent and no compensation. So if you think that’s a groundbreaking proposal, I suggest you think again.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">SAG-AFTRA will<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> now join the Writers Guild of America</a> (<a href=# id=auto-tag_wga data-tag=wga>WGA</a>), with over 11,000 scribes currently striking for livable wages, healthcare, and an updated contract. It’s the first strike featuring both writers and actors since 1960.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>AMPTP statement: “A strike is certainly not the outcome we hoped for as studios cannot operate without the performers that bring our TV shows and films to life.
