Earlier in his career, he gave hits like <i>Speed</i> and <i>Point Break</i>, which earned him recognition, and Reeves became one of the highest-paid actors <a href=#>after </a><a href=#><i>The Matrix</i></a><a href=#> trilogy</a> and the comedy gold <i>Bill And Ted’s Excellent Adventures</i>. Additionally, he became an action superstar with the <i>John Wick</i> series and continued to grow his portfolio. When the actor is not working, he is often spotted riding or tinkering with a bike. His love for motorcycles began in 1986 when he was in Munich and learned how to ride one. Since then, his collection has continued to grow in his garage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keanu Reeves has stepped into the role of designing bikes with his company Arch Motorcycles, where he customizes and creates bikes with co-owner Gard Hollinger. From a classic Harley-Davidson to riding a bike he customized, let’s look at the crazy expensive motorcycles in Keanu Reeves’ collection.</p><h2 id=1974-bmw-r75-6-8-200>1974 BMW R75/6 ($8,200)</h2><p>BMW may have recently gained traction for its bikes, but <a href=#>Keanu Reeves has had a special spot</a> for the 1974 R75/6 in his garage. While the ride doesn’t offer incomparable speed, it offers comfort for a long ride and effortless cruising, which is important for the actor who prioritizes ease over everything else in a bike from his collection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Deadpool Biker's Club: Inside Ryan Reynolds' Expensive Motorcycle Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=1973-norton-commando-850-mk2a-15-000>1973 Norton Commando 850 MK2A ($15,000)</h2><p>A fan of Norton Motorcycle Company, a British brand, Keanu Reeves had been fascinated with its unique structure and design since childhood. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Motorious</a>, the actor reportedly purchased the bike in the late 1980s, and the Commando 850 MK2A was the second ride in his collection. He also reminisced about spending a few good hours riding the bike around town.</p><h2 id=1984-harley-davidson-shovelhead-11-499>1984 Harley-Davidson Shovelhead ($11,499)</h2><p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin/317292736231574496/</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keanu Reeves has owned the third iteration of the OHV V-twin for a long time. Called the Shovelhead, the name is derived from the shape of the rocker heads, which are shaped like coal shovels. 1984 was the last year that Harley-Davidson launched the model, their first since Harley executives repurchased the company. The new bike came with a more elegant shape and an aluminum head to improve agility.</p><h2 id=suzuki-gs1100e-3-995>Suzuki GS1100E ($3,995)</h2><p>While the actor hasn’t shared much info about the Suzuki GS1100E, it remains a prized possession in his garage. The robust engine bike was first launched in 1980 and stayed in production for four years. It comes with a four-valve cylinder head, and its ergonomic features helped it perform well.</p><h2 id=kawasaki-ninja-zx-10r-18-000>Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R ($18,000)</h2><p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin/571816483935339493/</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>First introduced in 2004, the Kawasaki Ninja ZX-10R has been upgraded and launched in several interactions. With a 998 CC engine, the bike gives an output of 203 HP and comes with a tubeless tire. The Ninja ZX-10R has been the top choice for the actor to ride on tracks as the superbike is built for the racing streets rather than the jam-packed streets of Los Angeles, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo Autos</a>.</p><h2 id=suzuki-gsx-r750-12-549>Suzuki GSX-R750 ($12,549)</h2><p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin/706150416560323866/</p><p>The Suzuki GSX-R750 is considered one of the most popular 750 CC bikes worldwide and has had a varied history since its introduction in 1985. The high-performance ride was already lightweight, but the new upgrades also had an upgraded suspension system and liquid-cooling concept to offer better agility during long rides.</p><h2 id=kawasaki-kz-900-9-199>Kawasaki KZ 900 ($9,199)</h2><p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin/682787993519201145/</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another Kawasaki in the collection, Reeves bought the KZ 900 in 1996 when he began shooting <i>Chain Reaction</i> and lived in Chicago. A four-stroke model was launched in 1974 and was initially called the KZ1 before the name changed to 900. The laid-back bike was launched to compete with Honda with an American flair to persuade Western customers to buy the limited-edition stunner.</p><h2 id=2004-ducati-998-matrix-reloaded-edition-19-000>2004 Ducati 998 Matrix Reloaded Edition ($19,000)</h2><p>Ducati released a 996 bike with custom specifications in 2003 for the movie <i>Matrix Reloaded</i>, wherein Carrie Ann-Moss is spotted in a chase sequence in the film. However, as mentioned by <a href=#>Top Speed</a>, due to the popularity of the emerald green bike, Ducati launched the 998 edition a year later, with only 170 <i>Matrix</i> editions available for retail. The V-twin engine offers a 998 CC power to provide 123 HP.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=el-diablo-west-coast-chopper-150-000>El Diablo West Coast Chopper ($150,000)</h2><p>https://in.pinterest.com/pin/434175220308296867/</p><p><a href=#>A special custom bike in his collection, Keanu Reeves</a> took the El Diablo to West Coast Chopper, a Californian company, to design the bike from scratch and splash it with glossy black paint.
