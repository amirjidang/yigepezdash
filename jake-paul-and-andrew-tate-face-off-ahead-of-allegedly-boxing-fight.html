The pair have now added fuel to the fire over the potential mega-fight as Paul stared down with Tate in a boxing gym as the YouTuber's manager Nakisa Bidarian watched on.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>Jake Paul Offers NBA Star Draymond Green For Boxing Match For $10 Million</b></a></span></p><p>Paul captioned the video "negotiations" and a spokesman for Tate later told <a href=#><i>Mirror</i></a><i> Fighting</i>: "Negotiations have begun between the two parties, it’s a fight the fans have been asking for and it’s an event the world will remember."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tate has not fought in two years but has welcomed a return to the ring against Paul, who beat UFC legend Anderson Silva last month, or his older brother Logan. The 35-year-old has been at the forefront of media attention in recent months for his controversial views, which have seen him banned from social media platforms TikTok, Facebook, YouTube and Instagram.</p><p>Paul voiced his support for Tate following his social media ban, with the former kickboxer has also speaking highly of Paul's career switch to boxing by labelling him as the best influencer to take up the sport. Tate previously hinted a fight with Logan was more likely to happen than Jake, insisting he would only return to the ring against somebody he wanted to "hurt".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Logan and Jake are obviously on the cards, perhaps more Logan than Jake," he told Mirror Fighting. "I don't need money and I don't need credibility, I'm going to stay relevant for eternity. I'm going to be the most relevant voice for the masculine youth for the rest of human time. For me to fight, it's a personal decision because it's somebody I want to hurt. There's a lot of talk going on at the moment with a lot of different names."</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Dexerto</i></a>, A fight between the pair would certainly be interesting, especially given the heated rivalry between the Paul brothers and Tate. Logan has been the one that seemed closest to fighting Tate, but that appears to have changed.</p><p>As it stands, Jake hasn’t named his next opponent but he is eager to get back into the ring. So, we’ll just have to wait and see if it will be Tate or somebody else.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>Phoebe Bridgers Wins Against Defamation Lawsuit, Case Has Been Already Dismissed</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Mirror</a>, <a href=#>Dexerto</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3orfEZqearZxirq%2BwjJqlnaqVrHq1rdOeZJ%2BZk5p6sLLFZpihnZGZerCyjJqjpZ2XmrGtxYybprGhnpx6p7XGoato</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
