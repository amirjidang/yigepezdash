He’s an amazing guy and I wish him all the best. We’re friends. It just didn’t work out,” Robertson, 21, revealed to&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>on Wednesday, August 29, noting that the twosome are still on good terms. “He actually just texted me the other day and said he was thinking about me … and I think that’s beautiful. That’s how it should be.”</p><p class=p1>While the exes still follow each other on social media, eagle-eyed fans noticed that Robertson and North, 22, last posted Instagram photos together in June.</p><p class=p1>Robertson told <i>Us</i> that she is looking forward to single life, although she’s not currently focused on dating. She also explained that she doesn’t “necessarily have a type” and is seeking out someone with qualities she values.</p><p class=p1>“I’m looking for somebody who is the same way where things just matter and that faith is the most important thing in their life and they can be passionate about the things that we get to do and that’s an important quality,” Robertson noted, adding that she hopes for a relationship full of “purpose.”</p><p class=p1>North and Robertson met in 2016 after he sent her a DM via Twitter expressing his interest. The duo then swapped phone numbers, but things “fizzled out” because they never met in person, the <i>Duck Dynasty </i>alum told <a href=#><i>Entertainment Tonight </i></a>in April of this year. “Almost two years have gone by and I was in L.A. for my book press and my friend said she wanted to set me up with someone … to my surprise, it was Austin!”</p><p class=p1>The <i>Live Fearless </i>author and the <i>I Didn’t Do It </i>alum had an instant spark. “We both laughed and couldn’t believe the randomness of finally meeting [through] a friend who had no idea we even knew each other,” she added. “[We] had heart eyes for each other.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Robertson previously dated <strong>Blake Coward</strong> from March 2014 to March 2015.
