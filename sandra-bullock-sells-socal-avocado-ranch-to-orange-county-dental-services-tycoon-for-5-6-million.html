The recipient of various accolades, including an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award, Bullock was the world's highest-paid actress in 2010 and 2014. In 2010, she was named one of Time's 100 most influential people in the world Sandra Bullock. While the reliable box office busting actress and producer has added several properties to her cross-country portfolio over the last few years, including a second house in Beverly Hills, where she has long owned a fabled hilltop mansion, and two homes within Malibu’s famed Colony enclave, the serial property investor also shed several residences, including a waterfront getaway on Georgia’s Tybee Island and a couple of condos at the celeb-favored Sierra Towers in West Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED:</b><a href=#><b>The 10 Biggest Philanthropic Ventures Of Sandra Bullock</b></a></span></p><p>For the last 15 years, the “Miss Congeniality” star has surreptitiously — as in not one property gossip had ever cottoned to it — owned an avocado ranch squirreled away in the somewhat far-flung rolling foothills below Palomar Mountain, near the out-of-the-way community of Valley Center, Calif., about 25 miles east of the Pacific Ocean and 50 miles north of San Diego. But no more.</p><p>Listed earlier this year amid much publicity and ballyhoo at $6 million, the scenic 91-acre spread has been offloaded, per online records, for $5.6 million, more than twice the $2.725 million paid back in 2007. Tax records show the property was acquired through an LLC linked to a lavish mansion in Orange County’s upscale Newport Coast community that is owned by a dentist turned dental administrative services tycoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Comprised of three separate parcels, the ranch’s main residence sits atop a knoll with 360-degree mountain views. Built in 1990 and zhushed up in luxurious yet low-key manner befitting one of the world’s most famous and beloved actresses, the nearly 6,000-square-foot, single-story authentic adobe home wraps itself around a stone-paved courtyard with a fountain at its center. In addition to high-tech security and a comprehensive home automation system, the home offers nine fireplaces (six inside and three outside), and an electric car charging station.</p><p>According to <a href=#><i>DIrt</i></a>, Other notable creature comforts include four en-suite bedrooms, one that includes a kitchenette that makes it well suited for live-in staff or long-term guests. There are a total of six baths, a dining room that features a wet bar and a circular beamed ceiling, and bespoke farmhouse-style kitchen with an imported range that costs about as much as a Mercedes. French doors open most rooms to the outdoors, which offer vast, sunbaked flagstone terraces, fragrant flowering gardens, and a saltwater pool and spa set in a soccer pitch sized sweep of lawn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The ranch property also offers solar panels, a backup generator, RV hookups, and a chicken coop. Elsewhere, there’s a workshop for farm equipment and three-bedroom, two bathroom manufactured home perfect for a caretaker. The ranch is planted with about 1,200 avocado trees, plus a variety of citrus trees. And to keep it all sated, there are a total of seven water meters across the three parcels.</p><p>The property was listed by a constellation of agents: <a href=#>Kay O’Hara</a> of <a href=#>HomeSmart Realty West</a>; <a href=#>Alan Long</a> of <a href=#>Avenue 8</a>; <a href=#>Melissa Russell</a> at <a href=#>Willis Allen Real Estate</a>.</p><p>Though she resides primarily in Los Angeles, where her children attend school, Bullock, who starred in this year’s action-comedy “Bullet Train,” as well as the action-adventure feature “The Lost City,” which she also produced, still presides over substantial holdings from coast to coast. These include a townhouse in lower Manhattan, an ornate mansion in New Orleans, and more than half a dozen properties in and around Austin, Texas, including a six-acre compound along the Colorado River.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>MDLBeast Soundstorm 2022: Biggest Comeback Of All Time, Five Rap Legends Light Up The Big Beast Stage With DJ Khaled</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmasmZ6Zv6J5wa6jpaeToHq0sculqmarn5iurXnAr6acmZSkerOtzZyfZqyfYryzrc2gnGabn6q7tcWMnZynrJGherSx0a%2BgnJ2jYsG6r86opWaen6d6dnmVZqSipJyevK97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
