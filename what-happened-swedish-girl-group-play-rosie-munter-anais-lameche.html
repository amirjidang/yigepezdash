The four-member singing group was from Sweden and featured singers Rosie Munter, Anais Lameche, Faye Hamlin, and Anna Sundstrand. Their biggest hit was their first single, "Us Against The World." After their first two albums, lead singer Hamlin left the group and was replaced by the young singer, Janet Leon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>New Rules: Dua Lipa Is Changing Pop Music, Here's How</a></span></p><p>The band broke up in 2005 and eventually, Hamlin and Lameche got back together in 2009 and added Sanne Karlsson to their trio before ultimately splitting up again in 2010. There have definitely been lots of changes in the group since its original formation in 2001. The band has been through a lot of different reincarnations over the years, and we're here to explore what exactly happened between the young women who made up PLAY.</p><h2 id=faye-hamlin-left-the-group-in-2003><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Faye Hamlin Left The Group In 2003</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The group's lead singer, Hamlin, left the group in 2003 to further her education, according to an official press release from the band. She went on to attend college and began modeling. She attended a music school in Rytmus and signed with Swedish modeling agency, Skyncasting. She went on to film a commercial for MQ and recorded a cover of Fleetwood Mac's song, "Go Your Own Way" for the commercial. The full song was released for download and features Hamlin's familiar powerful vocals.</p><h2 id=play-replaced-hamlin-with-janet-leon-in-2003><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Play Replaced Hamlin With Janet Leon In 2003</span></h2><p>After Hamlin left the group, she was replaced by a young singer with a similar vocal range, Janet Leon. Leon recorded Play's third album with the other three girls in the group and went on tour with them. Their third album together would be the group's last, as they broke up in 2005. The last time the girls performed together was in December 2004. Rumors of the group's split made the rounds for a while until an official announcement of the group's break-up came in September 2005. The announcement stated that the group was on an "indefinite break."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hamlin-and-anais-lameche-reunited-in-2009><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Hamlin And Anais Lameche Reunited In 2009</span></h2><p>Hamlin and Lameche decided to get the group back together in 2009 and with Sundstrand showing no interest in rejoining and Munter pulling out at the last minute, the two added a third member to their trio named Sanne Karlsson. They were featured on the second season of the reality series Made in Sweden and released an album titled Under My Skin. They released a single called "Famous" from that album as well as a music video for the track, which reached number one in Sweden.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Of The Biggest One Hit Wonders Of The Early 2000s</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hamlin-left-the-group-again-in-2010><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Hamlin Left The Group Again In 2010</span></h2><p>Hamlin, for whatever reason, decided to leave the group once again in 2010 around the time the girls were going to try to bring the group's popularity back to the United States. Karlsson and Lameche replaced Hamlin with a friend of theirs named Emelie Norenberg. Hamlin went on to pursue a solo music career that ended in 2013, after accepting a record deal with Capitol Records that apparently went nowhere. Hamlin now works as a stylist for Plaza Interior Magazine. Play ended up splitting for good shortly after adding Norenberg to the group.</p><h2 id=many-of-the-girls-from-play-went-on-to-model><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Many Of The Girls From Play Went On To Model</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Several of the girls from Play went on to pursue modeling careers after Play split up, including Hamlin, Munter, and Sundstrand.
