They are now expecting their first child.</p><p>Osaka wrote on her <a href=#>social media</a><strong>, “Can’t wait to get back on the court, but here’s a little life update for 2023,”</strong> after posting a photo of the couple’s baby’s sonogram.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Can’t wait to get back on the court but here’s a little life update for 2023. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/GYXRnutU3I</a></p>— NaomiOsaka大坂なおみ (@naomiosaka) <a href=#>January 11, 2023</a><p>Cordae’s girlfriend is one of the most well-known figures in <a href=#>sports</a>. Still, the mental health champion has been vocal that she needs a supportive network to function at her best, especially compared to her partner.</p><p>She praised the Grammy-nominated rapper on Instagram, writing, <strong>“You’re a star and a light.”</strong></p><p>Cordae Amari Dunston has been actively involved in the music industry since his career began.&nbsp;</p><p>From starting in North Carolina to making a name for himself on YouTube, Cordae was determined to pursue his passion and succeeded. His initial success on YouTube led him to land a record deal with Atlantic Records in 2018.&nbsp;</p><p>Since then, he has released two highly successful projects, The Lost Boy and From a Bird’s Eye View, which has put him on the map for Grammy recognition.&nbsp;</p><p>By making it onto the nominees’ list for 2021, Cordae is proving that persistence pays off and no matter where you start from you can be at the very top of your craft.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship story&nbsp;</h2><p>Cordae, an American rap artist and songwriter, is no stranger to the limelight himself. He was recently featured by G.Q., where he revealed details about his and Osaka’s <a href=#>relationship</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Before anyone knew about them, they had been dating for roughly a year and Cordae shared that they tend to keep their relationship mostly under wraps.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple went on their first date in 2019 to watch an L.A. Clippers game, followed by their first kiss at Indian Wells, California.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Naomi Osaka is well known in her professional field as she was the first Asian player to take hold of the #1 spot on the Women’s Tennis Association singles rankings — having triumphed in two Australian Open championships and two U.S. Open titles until now.</p><p>She was born to a Haitian father. Up until the age of three, she was raised in Japan; at that point, her family moved to Long Island, New York. Her father urged her to start playing tennis there.</p><p>Osaka practiced tennis throughout the day and attended homeschool during the evening after the <a href=#>family</a> relocated to Florida in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>She chose not to compete in junior tournaments when she turned professional in 2013, and the Japanese Tennis Federation soon began to assist her.&nbsp;</p><p>She became one of the most promising young athletes in the following few years.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2BwKmnnqpdmLyzsMCeZKChoqGzs7XEp5to</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
