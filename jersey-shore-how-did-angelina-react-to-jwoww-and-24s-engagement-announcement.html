"I'll always be sorry for the speech because of the way that I thought I made her feel. But that doesn't give Angelina the right to say she can talk to me and it doesn't give my roommates the right to try and force us to have a conversation."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED ‚Äì<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Snooki Is Still Keeping Quiet Despite ‚ÄòJersey Shore‚Äô Rumors</a></span></p><p>Angelina of course, would also fire back, ‚ÄúThe f----ng girl is unpredictable," she said about Jenni. "I don't know what she's going to come in like. It's been 11 years of back and forth. This whole entire trip has been great up until this point but this girl always tries to sabotage it."</p><p>Turns out, the two were finally able to squash the beef. They kept things civil and Jenni would even take part in Angelina‚Äôs wedding redo. Though fans know, the beef between the two started long before, well into the early seasons. Another problem would arise when Angelina made mention that 24, Jenni‚Äôs now-fianc√©e, would get a little too touchy when they went out. Well, Jenni and Zack are now engaged, and fans are wondering what Angelina has to say, given the past tension.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=angelina-s-comments-on-jenni-s-ig-post>Angelina‚Äôs Comments On Jenni‚Äôs IG Post</h2><p>Things must be really good between Angelina and Jenni, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the JS star decided to comment on Jenni‚Äôs engagement post.</a> She was nothing but positive, showing support.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/angelina-ig-post.png><p><span class=related-single>RELATED ‚Äì<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">‚ÄòJersey Shore‚Äô Fans Are Still Speculating That Angelina And Chris Are Over</a></span></p><p>Several of the others commented including the likes of Snooki and Sammi.</p><p>Sammi: ‚ÄúCongratulations!! ‚ô•Ô∏èüíç.‚Äù</p><p>Snooki: ‚ÄúLove you guys so much.‚Äù</p><p>Lauren: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so excited for you two!!
