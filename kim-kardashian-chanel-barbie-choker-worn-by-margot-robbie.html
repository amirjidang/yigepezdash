The famous necklace boasts a dazzling array of multicolored gemstones, gold double-C charms, and elegant teardrop-shaped pearls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Viewers can spot the piece on Margot in the film shortly after she and her fellow Barbies hatch a plan to reclaim Barbie Land from the Kens. She arrives at Ken's flamboyant dojo casa, clad in her classic pink ensemble that features the nostalgic Chanel choker.</p><p>Notably, Robbie's rendition of the choker also boasts a strikingly large pink heart-shaped gemstone at its center, which is absent from Kim’s piece.</p><p>It's not clear how much the necklace is worth, but it likely set the SKIMS founder back a pretty penny. Various other vintage Barbie Chanel jewelry items have fetched prices <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ranging from $2,500 to $6,500 in the past</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, considering the exceptional rarity of the piece worn by Robbie (and now Kim) and its inclusion of several generously sized gemstones, it's highly probable that it’s valued at an even higher price.</p><p>This isn’t <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the first time Kim has been spotted wearing the choker</a>. In August, while traveling in Japan, the reality star shared a series of the shopping finds she’d made on the trip. One selfie posted to her Instagram Story showed Kim posing at Vintage Ecoland, a vintage designer store known to be frequented by celebrity clientele.</p><p>The image showed Kim holding a bubblegum-pink quilted Chanel handbag adorned with the chunky necklace wrapped around the purse's handle. With her signature duck lips, Kim struck a pose for the camera, accompanied by a gentleman who seemed to be a store employee.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"OMG best shopping in Japan," she captioned the image. "I'm in my barbie bag at @vintage_ecoland."</p><p>It was clearly a big shopping trip for Kim, as not only was the necklace likely worth tens of thousands of dollars, but the pink Chanel bag likely would’ve had a high price, too, considering <a href=#>purses from the designers often retail for more than $10,000</a> when new.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpKGdYriivsOaqqGhkaN6pLTAp5ylZZKWv6O1xGaaoaebmr9uw86rpWaaqWK6or7GqKtmqp%2BXr6qxjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
