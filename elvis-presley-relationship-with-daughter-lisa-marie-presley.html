A big enough deal that it seemed like every song he released became a hit, Elvis also became a major movie star amazingly enough. As a result of everything that he accomplished, Presley remains celebrated enough that <a href=#>new revelations about Elvis’ life</a> are still coming out decades after he passed away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Some ‘Home Alone’ Fans Think Elvis Presley Is Still Alive (And Appeared In The Movie)</a></span></p><p>Given the fact that Elvis has been so celebrated over the years, it makes sense that a lot of people have always seen him as larger than life. However, for anyone who wants to know who he was outside of the legend, all they have to do is look at <a href=#>Elvis’ relationship with his ex-wife Priscilla</a>. More importantly, it is fascinating to learn more about how close Elvis was to his daughter Lisa Marie Presley.</p><h2 id=how-close-were-elvis-presley-and-lisa-marie-presley>How Close Were Elvis Presley And Lisa Marie Presley?</h2><p>On February 1st, 1968, Elvis Presley’s only child Lisa Marie Presley was born. Years after Lisa Marie was born, Elvis got divorced from her mother Priscilla Presley. Unsurprisingly, Lisa Marie principally lived with her mom following the divorce. However, that doesn’t mean that Elvis disappeared from Lisa Marie’s life as she spent a lot of time with her father and even got to know the new woman in his life well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Elvis Presley’s girlfriend after his divorce, Linda Thompson, released a memoir titled “A Little Thing Called Life”. In the book, Thompson wrote about her life with Elvis before their breakup and her interactions with his daughter Lisa Marie Presley. In an especially amusing section, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thompson revealed that Lisa Marie once told her “my mommy doesn’t like you very much”</a> in reference to Priscilla Presley. If that doesn’t reveal that Elvis taught Lisa Marie to express herself freely to the other people in his life, nothing could.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Has Lisa Marie Presley Been Doing Recently?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since Elvis Presley passed away decades ago, the best way to learn about his relationship with his daughter is to rely on what Lisa Marie has said about the subject. When Lisa Marie has been willing to talk about the subject, she has made it completely clear that she adored her father and he felt the same way about her.</p><p>When asked to describe her father in an interview, here is what Lisa Marie had to say. “Protective, very adoring, and very watchful, and, um, I knew I was loved, there is no question about that. It’s not something that is easy to come by obviously but it was very apparent to me and it was very mutual.” In another interview, Lisa Marie revealed an amusing fact about her relationship with her father. “The only person who could get in the bathtub was my father. He’s the one who would have to actually put me in and make me. I wouldn’t argue with him ever.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How The Rock's Obsession With Elvis Was Secretly Shown In One Of His Films</a></span></p><p>Since Elvis Presley was rich and famous, it is known that he used his wealth to indulge most of his desires. During interviews, Lisa Marie has revealed that while her father was very protective, he also used his funds to let her get away with loads. For example, there was a room in his basement where Lisa Marie would throw and destroy things. Clearly, Elvis and Lisa Marie had a close bond before he passed away and loved each other completely.</p><h2 id=how-elvis-presley-rsquo-s-death-affected-lisa-marie-presley>How Elvis Presley’s Death Affected Lisa Marie Presley</h2><p>When Lisa Marie Presley was only nine years old, tragedy struck when her father Elvis Presley passed away. Fortunately, based on how Lisa Marie has reluctantly described her last interaction with her father before his death, it was a sweet moment. “I don’t like talking about this. It was August 16th, at 4am I was supposed to be asleep, actually. He found me and you know, go to bed and I said ok and I think he kissed me good night and I ran off. And he had come in and kissed me good night after that. That was the last time I saw him alive.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an ideal world, Lisa Marie wouldn’t have been in his home when her father took his last breath since she lived with her mother a lot of the time. Sadly, however, not only was Lisa Marie in Elvis’ house when he passed away, she witnessed his girlfriend at the time trying to wake his lifeless body as it lay on the floor. After witnessing that scene, Lisa Marie called Elvis’ ex-girlfriend Linda Thompson and exclaimed “My daddy’s dead! He’s smothered in the carpet!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When he passed away, <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley inherited a huge chunk of Elvis Presley’s massive fortune</a>. Despite that, it is abundantly clear that she would have given it all back to spend more time with her father. In fact, Lisa Marie has revealed that after he passed away, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she was comforted that it took days for Elvis’ body to be removed</a> from the house.</p><p>"His body was in the house for three days and there was something very oddly comforting about that, which made it not necessarily real to me. As I stayed in there with it almost the whole time.” Clearly, Lisa Marie’s life was profoundly affected by Elvis’ untimely demise.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>15 Surprising Facts About Lisa Marie, Elvis Presley's Daughter</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGicpa6ZqHqxvsSso56xXaeyra3Toqanq5ievW7DyK2fZpyRqrSpwMSrZKWho5Z6rq3RopxmqKKawK2x2Gg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
