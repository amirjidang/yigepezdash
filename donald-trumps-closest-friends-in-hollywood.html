Even before ascending the political ladder, <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Donald Trump</a></strong> and his family have always been successful socialites with high-profile connections. But despite their fame, Trump's list of friends isn't as long as you might expect of a former American president– and there's a reason for it. Not only have many celebrities kept their distance from the family since Trump's election in 2016, but some have also even completely changed their stance on being friends with the business mogul.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn't a surprising development since Trump’s public persona is brash, and for a relentlessly social person, he holds very controversial opinions. This accounts for him losing friends and gaining some new enemies—in Hollywood, to be precise. However, a closer look into Trump's lifestyle and relationships reveals a man who enjoys his privacy. He might be big on glad-handing and back-slapping, but once the party's over, he goes back to his own bed. Being friends with the former President of the United States sure has its perks, and the Trump circle probably enjoys it first-hand. Here's a look at some people who might be enjoying these benefits in Hollywood.</p><h2 id=emmy-rossum><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Emmy Rossum</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Emmy Rossum is presumably friendly with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Trump family</a>. The Shameless actress has been close to the former president's daughter Ivanka Trump for years. They go all the way back to 2009 when Ivanka married her husband, Jared Kushner. The two women have remained tight ever since. Rossum once interviewed Ivanka for Hamptons Magazine, and there the former president's daughter described the actress as a "good friend." Rossum also hangs out with Ivanka often, attends private functions, and usually parties with the Trumps.</p><h2 id=tiger-woods><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Tiger Woods</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pro golfer Tiger Woods has made news several times in the past year over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his friendship with Donald Trump</a>. The pair were friends before Trump became president and even during his presidency, Wood would often subtly show support for his friend. Speaking about his friendship with Trump, the athlete once said, "Well, I've known Donald for a number of years, We’ve played golf together.&nbsp;We've had dinner together. I’ve known him pre-presidency and obviously during his presidency."</p><h2 id=paris-hilton><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Paris Hilton</span></h2><p>Famed heiress Paris Hilton also makes the list of Trump's friends in Hollywood. Hilton and Trump are said to have been friends long before he became president of the United States of America. Hilton was a part of Trump's now-defunct eponymous modeling agency. According to Cosmopolitan, Hilton and Ivanka also used to party together. It is, therefore, no surprise that the former model supported and voted for him to become president.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kanye-west><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Kanye West</span></h2><p>Many would describe Trump as racist, but Kanye West does not agree. These two highly controversial people have a friendship that is almost hard to believe is genuine. But we also can't dismiss it as ingenuine. The famous rapper is one of Trump's closest friends in Hollywood, with the former president once saying to the press that he and Kanye are "just friends, just friends. He's a good man, doing well. We've been friends for a long time."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little Known Facts About Donald And Melanie Trump's Marriage</a></span></p><h2 id=sean-p-diddy-combs><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sean "P Diddy" Combs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>American rapper, and business mogul, Sean Combs makes this list. Combs, popularly known as P Diddy, is also a friend of the former POTUS. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, Combs compared his status to Trump's, describing them both as "model moguls.” Combs, known for his entrepreneurship, said that he and Trump are alike as they're both hardworking and business-minded. Combs publicly displays his love for Trump as he can't help but mention how he admires Trump's style and how close they are.</p><h2 id=tom-brady><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tom Brady</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is no news that Donald Trump has been openly critical of the intermingling of sports and politics. However, this certainly hasn't affected <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his friendship with famous quarterback Tom Brady</a>. The NFL star never takes Trump's criticism to heart, and you will often find him defending their years-long friendship. Brady once admitted to always having a good time with the former president. From what we can tell, Trump sure knows how to maintain balance and keep his business out of his private life with his friends.</p><h2 id=martha-stewart><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Martha Stewart</span></h2><p>American businesswoman, writer, and former model Martha Stewart also makes this list as she is tight buddies with Trump. Stewart usually attends Trump's parties, confirming that they belong to the same social circle. With both of them having a reputation for being very business-minded, there is no doubt that Stewart and Trump have a lot to bond over.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Facts About Donald Trump's Relationship With The Clintons</a></span></p><h2 id=kelly-ripa><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kelly Ripa</span></h2><p>Trump seems to have an eye for good-looking women, and he has a good number of them in his circle. American actress, talk show host, and television producer Kelly Ripa makes this list of Trump friends too. The television personality is also a very close friend of the former president. Their bond has become increasingly stronger over the years, and it is not uncommon to find Ripa at many of Trump's private family parties and functions.</p><h2 id=kathy-hilton><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Kathy Hilton</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's a family affair! Not only did Paris Hilton make this list, her mom did too. American actress, fashion designer, and philanthropist, Kathy Hilton, is also a good friend to Trump. As it turns out, the Hiltons and Trump's have been family friends for a long time. Seeing how close they have become over the years, it is not uncommon to find the Hiltons at Trump family parties. Even after becoming the president, Trump maintained his relationship with Kathy and her daughter, and they were often spotted at parties together.</p><h2 id=mike-tyson><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Mike Tyson</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Arguably one of Trump's longest friends, Tyson and the business mogul date back to he 90's. And while <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their friendship</a> continues to raise eyebrows, Tyson and Trump never hesitate to support each other when needed.&nbsp; When the famous boxer was serving his six year prison sentence, Trump made it clear to all who cared to listen that the ruling was a travesty and Tyson did not deserve it.</p><p>Trump might not be many people's favorite person, but he sure knows his onions when it comes to making famous friends. And like it or not, these stars remain very loyal to their bond with him!</p><p>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 People In Donald Trump's Inner Circle (5 Who Definitely Are Not)</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqKaRobFuwNGupKmrXZi5sL%2FErKtmnqKesq%2Bw0magp2WYpLmtxdaopp1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
