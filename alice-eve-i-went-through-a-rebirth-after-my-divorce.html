It’s so clearly placed there for you with divorce,” the 36-year-old actress told&nbsp;Us Weekly exclusively at the 2018 Women in Film Max Mara Face of the Future Award Recipient event on Tuesday, June 12. “So after that, things that I thought were frivolous or dismissed, like, ‘My hair is my hair,’ I was like, ‘Let’s look at the hair. What should it be? I can choose it.’ So yeah, there’s a bit more choice and ownership after divorce, I think.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/alice-eve.jpg><p>Eve detailed which parts of her life she paid more attention to after her split from <strong>Alex Cowper-Smith</strong>. “You look at relationships, friendships, things you spend your time on. In a way you want to be. I looked forward suddenly and was like, ‘Where do I want to be at 45? What do I want to have in my life or not have in my life?’” she said. “Because actually, I know that life has its own twists and turns, but you can try and make some plans, and some of them do come to fruition.”</p><p>She added: “You can kind of streamline a little bit. I think I valued my family a lot more and didn’t take it for granted. Yeah, it was a rebirth.” (The <a href=#>high school&nbsp;sweethearts</a> wed in December 2014 and split&nbsp;two years later.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Eve’s role in the upcoming film&nbsp;Replicas, which is set to be released in August, helped her cope with the changes in her own world because her character experienced something similar. “It was interesting, because I had just gone through a divorce, and so after divorce, you have to be reborn, or God help you,” she explained. “Yes, so there was a lot of conversation on set about the rebirth of my character. … And it was nice to be reborn.” The Brit stars alongside <a href=#><strong>Keanu Reeves</strong></a> in the movie about a man who tries to bring his family members back to life after an accident.</p><p>The&nbsp;Star Trek: Into Darkness&nbsp;actress told&nbsp;Us&nbsp;she found romance again, but it took going outside the U.S. “Leave. Leave if you’re single,” she quipped. “I have a boyfriend in New Zealand. That’s my answer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapJmYsm6x1Z5komWnmru1edOhqaitl516onnRnpmiqqSdeqKy056pZqWpYrGqws6rmp5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
