We receive compensation when you click on a link and make a purchase. <a href=# rel>Learn more!</a></p><p><i data-stringify-type=italic>Us Weekly has affiliate partnerships so we may receive compensation for some links to products and services.</i></p><p>When <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></a> does something, we’re paying attention. While she’s been beloved by fans for decades, she’s less in the spotlight than others. She doesn’t have an Instagram page where she documents her daily activities and outfits, and we don’t hear too much about her personal life other than quotes about parenting here and there with husband and&nbsp;That ’70s Show costar&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a>.</p><p>That’s why we get excited when we catch a glimpse of the Four Good Days actress out and about on a casual day. What makes Us even more excited is when she wears something we can buy for ourselves. Even better? When she wears multiple things we can buy for ourselves! She recently stepped out in Brentwood, California <a href=# rel=noopener>wearing JEN7 blue jeans and Allbirds Tree Dashers</a> — plus a simple baggy tee and face mask — and we have links to the jeans and the shoes for you to grab too!</p><p><strong>JEN7 High Waist Ankle Skinny Jeans</strong></p><figure class=wp-caption></figure><p>These jeans, which just so happen to be on sale for 25% off right now, are the type of everyday staple you need ASAP. You probably already own blue skinny jeans, but this pair may have you ditching them thanks to its stretchy, comfy fabric.</p><p>Our favorite part, however, is the signature enhanceME pockets. They secretly provide a sculpting effect at the waist! No one will know anything — except how good you look!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">JEN7 High Waist Ankle Skinny Jeans</a> (originally $99) for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$74</a> at Nordstrom!

She’s a <a href=# rel=noopener>longtime fan of the brand</a>. The Tree Dasher is Allbirds’ breathable running shoe designed for “maximum energy return.” Obviously, it will work beautifully with any casual outfit though!</p><p>It’s also made with renewable materials, as expected from Allbirds. Its knit upper is made from eucalyptus, and its SweetFoam midsole is made from carbon negative green EVA. Your feet will feel great in a pair of Tree Dashers — and you’ll feel great about your impact (or lack thereof) on the environment!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Women’s Tree Dashers</a> for just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">$125</a> at Allbirds!
