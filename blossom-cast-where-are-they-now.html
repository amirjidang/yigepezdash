Bialik (Blossom Russo), Lawrence (Joey Russo), <strong>Jenna von Öy</strong> (Six Lemeure), <strong>Michael Stoyanov</strong> (Anthony Russo), <strong>Ted Wass</strong> (Nick Russo), <strong>David Lascher</strong> (Vinnie Bonitardi), <strong>Portia Dawson</strong> (Rhonda Jo Applegate), Barnard Hughes (Buzz Richman), <strong>Finola Hughes</strong> (Carol Russo) and <strong>Courtney Chase</strong> (Kennedy Russo) starred on the series.</p><p>Bialik, for one, carried her experience as the titular character with her into her other defining television role on&nbsp;<a href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a>. “I think I’m the only one who <a href=#>didn’t steal anything [from the set]</a> because I thought we’re not supposed to,” the actress exclusively told&nbsp;Us Weekly&nbsp;in May 2019 after wrapping the CBS sitcom. “That’s the thing. On&nbsp;Blossom, we weren’t allowed to take anything.”</p><p>But perhaps she will have another chance at some point. “We get asked to do [a revival] all the time. Mayim and I talk frequently,” Lawrence revealed to&nbsp;Us&nbsp;in July 2017. “<a href=#>Mayim is interested in doing some type of reunion</a> with the show and so am I. If we can find the right piece and the right way in for a reboot/reunion, we’re both open to it. There’s a lot of talk around it, so we’ll see!”</p><p>The actor added at the time: “We’ve talked about [it] and it’s about the public’s excitement continuing to grow, and we’re trying to find the right way in. Then we’re down!”</p><p>Fans received a small taste of what they had been hoping for in June 2014. Bialik, Lawrence, von Oÿ and Stoyanov <a href=#>reunited to shoot promos for the show</a> as it prepared to return in syndication on the Hub Network. The former costars gave diehards a peek at the gathering via Twitter.</p><p>“Um…@joeylawrence @MikeStoyanov @JennavonOy,” Bialik wrote at the time. “We still look like young whippersnappers.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Lawrence tweeted that it was “so awesome” being with his former castmates again: “Feels like no time has passed. Love you all.”</p><p>Scroll down to see what the&nbsp;Blossom&nbsp;cast has been up to since the show ended in 1995.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXubC%2F0qikZpuRqMFuw8eeqZ5lkaeybsDHnrBmpp%2BsfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
