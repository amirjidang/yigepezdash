According to the same source, Garner is not pushing Miller for marriage. "That’s not her," the insider said. "He’s crazy about her too. She’s happy with the way her life is right now.

"All the kids have met him and each other, it wasn’t a big deal," the insider said. "The blending of all the families has happened at a very natural progression. They’re all just going on with their lives."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, Garner and Miller <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took things slowly when it came to their children</a>, and they didn't introduce everyone to each other immediately.

In fact, their father's current fiancée Jennifer Lopez also has two children from her previous marriage. According to a source for Life & Style, <a href=#>Garner and Affleck's kids love spending time with Lopez's twins Emma and Max</a>, especially since they are close in age. "Ben’s kids, especially Seraphina and Samuel, get on with J. Lo’s twins, Emme and Max. They’re all super close," the insider revealed, adding that the children love fun nights in "watching movies on a huge screen and eating popcorn. They [also] enjoy going to theme parks, museums, bowling, burger joints, escape rooms, and even simple things."

Of course, this also means that the kids have a great relationship with both, John Miller and Jennifer Lopez. However, it seems as if both Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck tend to keep their children's lives private which is why not much is known about the children's relationship with their new partners directly from them — most of the information comes from sources close to the stars, as well as paparazzi pics.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="Where Do Jennifer Garner And Ex-Husband, Scott Foley Stand Today?">Where Do Jennifer Garner And Ex-Husband, Scott Foley Stand Today?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsButsSnpaKelad6qK3Rp5yrZZSWwaq6xmahqKCeYrqquMueqWajmZnAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
