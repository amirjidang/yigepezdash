After more than a decade as queens of fashion, social media, and reality television, the time is fast approaching when that reign will end. Those who know anything about the ends of empires and royalty know that they rarely end pleasantly. Just look up what happened to the last Tsar of Russia to learn how that goes.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is Why Kim Kardashian Is Seeking A Restraining Order</a></span>Although the family remains phenomenally wealthy, they seem to be losing clout. There are many reasons why fans over the Kardashians; Kim has made <a href=#>some problematic comments that are now viral TikTok sounds</a>, allegations about the family's sinister rise to power keep surfacing, to name a few. Here are some of the many reasons why the Kardashians are no longer the institutions they once were.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=their-history-of-shoddy-endorsements><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Their History Of Shoddy Endorsements</span></h2><p>One thing that irritated many of their fans is the family's growing list of bad endorsements. Khloe, Kim, and the Jenner girls have all been called out at some point for endorsing products that turned out to be scams. There were<a href=#> Khloe's hair growth gummies</a>, Kim's flat tummy teas, <a href=#>and even weight-loss lollipops</a>. All of these, and several other products, turned out to be complete bunk.</p><h2 id=kanye-west><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Kanye West</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although she divorced him and <a href=#>is getting $200,000 a month</a> in child support, the fact that Kim Kardashian remained loyal to the increasingly problematic rapper for so long was enough to raise the eyebrows of many. West has since outed himself as an antisemite, conspiracy theorist, and fan of Adolph Hitler. Kim has four children with this man.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Kanye West Losing Custody Of His Kids And Who Is Currently Taking Care Of Them</a></span></p><h2 id=their-constant-photoshopping><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Their Constant Photoshopping</span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian and her sisters have all been called out for photoshopping their Instagram photos multiple times, which many argue reinforces unrealistic and unhealthy body image standards.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=animal-rights><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Animal Rights</span></h2><p>Animal rights activists are not fans of the Kardashian-Jenners because of their notorious love of fur clothing. Anti-fur activists have picketed many Kardashian events,<a href=#> including Kim's book signings.</a></p><h2 id=fatphobic-story-lines-on-the-kardashians><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Fatphobic Story Lines On The Kardashians</span></h2><p>Cosmopolitan and other sources claim that many fans began to stop watching The Kardashians (their show on Hulu) when the show began to emphasize more <a href=#>weight loss storylines</a> than their previous show, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, did. The Kardashians and their problematic beauty standards have always been a drag on their popularity, but it would seem even some of their most dedicated followers are sick of it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kim Kardashian Really Lose 16-Pounds In 21 Days?</a></span></p><h2 id=the-ray-j-tape-allegations><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Ray-J Tape Allegations</span></h2><p>Kim Kardashian's sex tape with musician Ray-J made her famous and many argue it was the catalyst that launched her family's reality TV dynasty. The family has always claimed that the sex tape leak happened without Kim's consent. However, Ray-J and several others <a href=#>allege that Kim's mother Kris was the one who released the tape</a> intending to get a reality show.</p><h2 id=their-inconsistent-politics><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Their Inconsistent Politics</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kim irritated many, especially leftists and liberals, when she was seen dining with Ivanka Trump, the daughter of disgraced President and January 6th coup leader Donald Trump. Kim has always been a self-pronounced Democrat, dining with the likes of Hillary Clinton. But her connection to Ivanka Trump and her endorsement <a href=#>of conservative candidate Rick Caruso</a> for mayor of Los Angeles over progressive Democrat Karen Bass further enraged the left. Caruso lost to Bass by almost 90,000 votes, nearly 9% of the total votes cast, his campaign cost nearly $100 million.</p><h2 id=kim-s-classism><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Kim's Classism</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another reason many of Kim's left-of-center fans have abandoned her was her out-of-touch comments about their work ethic. In an interview promoting their move to Hulu, Kim at one point viciously said, "Get your f**king ass up and work, it's like no one wants to work anymore." The internet was quick to point out that the Kardashians inherited a great portion of their wealth, and that nepotism played a huge role in their success. People who were married to billionaires like Kanye West are not exactly in a position to talk about hard work.</p><h2 id=plane-gate><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Plane-gate</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, news broke that Kylie Jenner took a short, less than a 20-minute flight on her private jet to get around Los Angeles traffic. Private jets are major causes of pollution and in turn climate change. It only got worse for the family when news broke that this was also a regular habit for most of the Kardashians and Jenners. Kim and Kylie were both implicated <a href=#>as some of the biggest stars with the worst carbon footprints</a>. Perpetuating the ongoing and increasingly dangerous climate crisis is one of the easiest ways to lose fans.</p><h2 id=their-past-ties-to-balenciaga><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Their Past Ties To Balenciaga</span></h2><p>Although Kim and the rest are reconsidering their connections to the brand because of the scandal, their past connection to the fashion house is a real problem for the family. Balenciaga got a wave of online hate when pictures of an ad campaign that involved children near BDSM gear came out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-public-is-getting-tired-of-their-schtick><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>The Public Is Getting Tired Of Their Schtick</span></h2><p>Another reason the Kardashians have lost clout is that fans think <a href=#>they have become too predictable</a>. Their new show is almost no different from their original series on E!. Everyone expects that Kim is going to show off her partners (like Pete Davidson), that Khloe will struggle with body image issues (while also perpetuating ridiculous beauty standards somehow), and that Kourtney will share some PDA with Travis Barker. In other words, they are losing their edge.</p><h2 id=income-inequality><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Income Inequality</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Income inequality in the U.S. is at an all-time high, and it was only made worse by the COVID pandemic and lockdowns of 2020. While the Kardashians enjoy huge piles of cash and live in luxury, millions of Americans are dealing with a diminishing standard of living. Poor and hungry people can't relate easily to someone who doesn't know how to <a href=#>peel bananas</a><a href=#> or cut cucumbers</a>. As poverty rises, so does disdain for the rich, just ask Marie Antoinette.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpmjpLu0edahsGasmJp6rK3RnZisoJmWu7R5x5qtnmWcpMC1ecWapaxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
