For the most part, there are no shortcuts. If you want to lose that belly and to be able to bounce a quarter off your stomach then you have to eat healthily and put the work in at the gym.</p><p>As it turns out, simply having a hard stomach should not be the ultimate goal. If your stomach is hard it does not always mean that you are the epitome of good health. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Men's Health</a> recently pointed out that if your stomach is hard it can actually mean quite the opposite and that your health might be at risk rather than in tip-top condition.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HERE'S HOW MUCH EXERCISE YOU NEED TO OPTIMIZE YOUR BRAIN</a></strong></p><p>via puregym.com</p><p>Chances are if you have the unhealthy type of hard stomach then you'll know about it. It doesn't come with doing sit-ups and stomach crunches. It's caused by something called visceral fat. That fat will push against your abdominal wall and create something of a gut, but it won't jiggle like regular belly fat, also known as&nbsp;subcutaneous fat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are a few things that can cause visceral fat to build up in this way. First off the most obvious one, diet and lifestyle. If you eat poorly and don't exercise you may very well have a hard belly, but not the kind we're all striving for. Next up, genetics. A study has shown that three different genes can affect your waist-to-hip ratio and thus dictate how much visceral fat you have. A healthy lifestyle can help counteract that though.</p><p>A large amount of visceral fat can have a detrimental effect on your health, causing scary things like cardiovascular disease and type two diabetes. Like any type of fat though, it can be lost. In fact, if you lose between 5 and 10% of your overall body weight that can strip away as much as 40% of the visceral fat you have stored up. Your best bet is to squeeze in plenty of cardio and make sure you tweak that diet.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>DO PLANKS EVERY DAY FOR AMAZING BODY BENEFITS</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmiqn5i4brTAq5tmq6SkuqKvx2afnpmcqbVw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
