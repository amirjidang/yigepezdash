Carrano was let go by WWE this week after it was discovered that he placed Mickie James' belongings in a trash bag when she received her marching orders from the company.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon have issued apologies to James, with HHH revealing the employee responsible for ill-treating released talent has been fired by WWE. Hunter did not mention any names in his announcement but it's&nbsp;now known that the persons in question were James and Carrano.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a class=bc-title-link title='WWE&#39;s "Garbage Bag" Treatment Has Been Going On For Over A Decade' href=#>WWE's "Garbage Bag" Treatment Has Been Going On For Over A Decade</a></span></p><p>It's also since been reported that the garbage bag treatment is nothing new in WWE and has been happening for over a decade. Maria Kanellis actually had it happen to her twice.</p><p>A source is reported to have told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WrestlingNews.co</a> that Mark's days were numbered after John Laurinaitis was brought back to work alongside him as the Head of Talent Relations. <a href=#>Vince McMahon</a>&nbsp;was also reportedly growing tired of him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Mark-Carrano-Eva-Marie-and-Mandy-Rose-WWE.com_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Carrano gave them a reason to fire him because we all knew once Johnny was back that Carrano would be out soon," the source was quoted as saying. "He had a lot of enemies and I think he was going to be out soon anyway. I don’t think anyone is too sad to see him go. People were seeing that Vince was getting tired of him.”</p><p>Former WWE referee Mike Chioda also lashed out at Carrano on his podcast in January, claiming he believed the former Head of Talent Relations was among the persons who got him released from WWE last year.</p><p>“He is a smart mark, not his first name, but a smart mark to the business. He knows anything and everything. He couldn’t look you in the eye. He wasn’t straightforward with you," Chioda said. "I didn’t believe him. Even when he called me, he lied to me that day when he called me to let me go. I believe he was one of the guys who put me up on the chopping block. I know it didn’t come from Vince and Stephanie who said, “Let’s cut Mike Chioda and cut his payroll because his payroll is so huge.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=it-was-inevitable>It Was Inevitable</h2><p>Other folks are reported to have voiced similar sentiments about Carrano in private. While there's always the chance of persons returning to WWE after they get fired, WrestlingNews.co claims to have been told that Mark is unlikely to ever return.</p><p>It appears Mark Carrano was going to get fired in any case and WWE was just waiting on a slip-up. We can't help but wonder if he would have gotten dropped for preparing Mickie's "care package" if he were someone else.</p><p>Source: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WrestlingNews.co</a></p><p style=text-align:center><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title='Undertaker Clarifies What He Meant When He Called WWE Product "Soft"' href=#>Undertaker Clarifies What He Meant When He Called WWE Product "Soft"</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeemsS0e9WipZydXaKwrq3HqKVmrJmnsqV5zJqppGWTlr%2Bzrc2oZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
