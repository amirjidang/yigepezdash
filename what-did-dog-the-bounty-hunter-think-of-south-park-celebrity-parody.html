A lot of people don't know Matt Stone <a href=#>does talk into his sleeve</a> to record Kenny's voice. Aside from that, there are a lot of things known about the hilarious yet brutally honest show. It has reflected a mirror on modern society, and has completely changed the world for (mostly) the better. At the very least, it's definitely improved the world of entertainment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show was created by Matt Stone and Trey Parker and has aired entirely on Comedy Central. Recently, it's found itself on HBO Max and Paramount+, where it consistently tops the Popular sections of those shows. For those that haven't seen it, the show revolves around rowdy 4th graders. The 4 main characters have certainly become iconic in their own ways. The biggest character on the show would have to be Eric Cartman, the crudest and most psychotic of the bunch.</p><p>With Season 26 of South Park on the way (they've already <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">teased it</a>), it's time to talk about an important episode from the show's history. One of his most popular and memorable moments came when Cartman was entrusted to become the temporary Hall Monitor for the school. Of course, chaos would ensue, and he would attempt to imitate Dog the Bounty Hunter.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Was Dog The Bounty Hunter's New Wife's Net Worth Before Marrying Him</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Dog was one of the biggest reality stars at the time of the episode's airing. He has kind of gotten lost in the bigger wave of reality entertainment, but one way he was immortalized was through this episode. Many have wondered, how has Dog reacted to Cartman's imitation of him? Let's find out.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-south-park-39-s-portrayal-of-dog-the-bounty-hunter>Everything To Know About South Park's Portrayal Of Dog The Bounty Hunter</h2><p>This particular episode was definitely raunchy.</p><p>This episode aired in season 10. One of South Park's most acclaimed seasons, it was the pinnacle of an era where South Park fused great storytelling with its old-school surrealist comedy. The season featured classics such as "Make Love, Not Warcraft", "Stanley's Cup" and of course, this particular episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason ‘South Park’s World Of Warcraft Episode Was So Revolutionary</a></span></p><p>The episode had two plots, which ended up converging into one main plot in the second half of the episode. Cartman's plot was really the secondary B plot to the...bizarre A plot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/south-park-left-and-dog-the-bounty-hunter-right.jpg><p>The main story is about how Ike ends up secretly dating his teacher, which would certainly be troubling if it were to happen in real life. The show asks a lot of questions, and because of the show's nature, answers them in funny ways. Of course, one of the main answers is Cartman's Dog persona. He finds out about the relationship and sees that he has to solve the problem himself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/eric-cartman-as-the-hall-monitor.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cartman would also have help with fictional one-off parodies of Dog's real life crew, including Dog's deceased ex Beth Chapman. While Cartman dressing up as Dog and acting like him was the main parody, what made it stand out was the inclusion of Dog's crew. It really cemented the lengths Eric would go to imitate Dog, someone Cartman really must have looked up to.</p><p>A fun fact about this episode is that this is where the legendary "Nice" meme originated. For those who haven't seen the meme, a bunch of cops keep saying "nice" in a smooth and natural way. If it didn't go on for nearly a minute, that is.</p><h2 id=how-did-dog-the-bounty-hunter-react-to-his-south-park-portrayal>How Did Dog The Bounty Hunter React To His South Park Portrayal?</h2><p>Dog had a really cool reaction to South Park's portrayal of him.</p><p>Years after the episode aired, Dog wrote and released an autobiography called You Can Run But You Can't Hide. In that book, Dog wrote about his time on his show. He also wrote about the South Park parody of him, and he actually liked it. Specifically, he said that "you know you've really made it when they include you on their show".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Dog-the-Bounty-Hunter-Interview.jpg><p>It makes a lot of sense that Dog would enjoy South Park's portrayal of him. For starters, they went easy on him, never really making fun of him. Second, aside from his bounty-hunting career, he seems to be a pretty fun and chill guy.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Went On Between Nicolas Cage And Dog The Bounty Hunter?</a></span></p><p>Part of this comes from a recent move he's made. Dog <a href=#>sold his mansion</a> to move to Florida, a state many celebrities and millionaires have moved to. Florida is seen as a wild state, but it's pretty cool and calm in certain areas. Dog's also approved his coolness by <a href=#>escaping</a> a Mexican prison sentence.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-did-other-celebrities-react-to-their-infamous-south-park-portrayals>How Did Other Celebrities React To Their Infamous South Park Portrayals?</h2><p>Dog is one of few that have had positive reactions to his South Park portrayal. Kanye's infamous South Park parodies have caused the rapper to name drop them in songs and interviews. Not always in a positive light, either. The show's had a long-term feud with Tom Cruise, and he doesn't seem to like the show very much because of it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/South-Park-cast-shocked.jpg><p>Gigi Hadid is one of the rare celebrities who, like Dog, seemed to think appearing on South Park was a good thing. She posted on social media about it and claimed she finally "made it". Jennifer Aniston once <a href=#>even appeared on South Park</a>, so she's another star who loves the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For the hardcore South Park fans, Matt and Trey bought the real Casa Bonita restaurant in Colorado and are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about to re-open it</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrGqsIydpqBlpJ2ybq7OrqWtsV2dwq%2FAxKtkraCZo7huu8VmqqitpJ16sa3RpGScnZyar7O107JkqZmipLG6ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
