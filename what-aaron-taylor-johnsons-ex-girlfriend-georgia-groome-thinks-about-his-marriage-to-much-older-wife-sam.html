Most of all, his <a href=#>marriage to his older wife Sam Taylor-Johnson</a> is still the subject of much debate. Since she is 23 years his senior, people can't help but focus on the age gap.</p><p>A year before he met Sam Taylor-Johnson on the set of Nowhere Boy, Aaron Taylor-Johnson was rumored to be in a relationship with actress Georgia Groome.
