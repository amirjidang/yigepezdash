However, it appears to also have gotten her into a tricky financial situation, as she now owes nearly $1 million in unpaid taxes on previous earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>According to The Sun</a>, the reality star was hit with a new lien for $290,297 earlier this month related to unpaid taxes from 2018, 2020, and 2021. This comes only months after Leah made headlines for being slapped with a $489,000. In total, the former teen mother now owes over $779,000 in federal and state taxes.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Prince Harry & Meghan Markle Have Reportedly Hired Divorce Lawyers</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, the reality star has had money troubles for years. It was first reported that she owed back due taxes in November 2020. At the time, she had a lien of $155,000, which has now grown to nearly a million-dollar debt.</p><p>The unpaid taxes for back nearly a decade, with the first debts being incurred in 2015.</p><p>In 2019, Leah discussed her financial situation on her co-star Kailyn Lowry’s Coffee Convos podcast. The mother-of-three admitted to having a history of giving money to friends and family, despite negative repercussions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I always want people to know I’m still that humble person and I felt [that] giving to everyone, I would get in return … but in the end it still hurt me,” <a href=#>she said at the time</a>.</p><p>“It hurt me, like, it caused one of my divorces, with Jeremy [Calvert], because I would be giving to everyone,” Leah continued. “I gave my dad $40,000, just to keep my dad around.”</p><p>Leah’s financial situation was further exposed last year on Teen Mom: The Next Chapter, when she bought a house with her then-fiancé, Jaylan Mobley. Even though she paid for the house, only Jaylan’s name was added to the deed, presumably because Leah’s tax situation would make it difficult to secure a mortgage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple broke up shortly after, though Leah has continued to live in the home despite not being listed on the deed.</p><p>So far, Leah hasn’t commented on recent reports of her newest tax lien.</p><p>Leah isn’t the only Teen Mom star to face tax trouble. As of August 2022, Tyler Baltierra and Catelynn Lowell (who are also original cast members) reportedly still owe over $300,000 in federal and state taxes.</p><p>In 2021, the former teen parents were previously hit with a lien worth over $500,000 over unpaid taxes for the years 2016 and 2017. The reality stars are reportedly still paying the debt off.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner’s Makeup Brand In Trouble After Evidence Of ‘Unsanitary’ Conditions</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>The Sun</a>, <a href=#>The Ashley</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBprHNZqSopV2owaK%2BjKWcmqBdorK0v8SrZKivlah6r7HAq6OyZWFiuqq4y6Kmp2WZo3q2us%2BaoJ1lpJbFpr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
