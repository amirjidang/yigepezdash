Fans — and the <a href=#>Riverdale</a> star himself — wasted no time in crack-ing jokes at the NSFW image.</p><p>“Good Morning to my publicity team,” the Disney Channel alum, 29, captioned the naked selfie via Instagram on Tuesday, June 7. Sprouse, who is sporting a goatee and tousled brown locks in the picture, made sure to angle the camera at the full-length mirror behind him in order to capture his naked body from the back. Notably, his backside seems edited to appear larger and rounder.</p><p>“Why the long bottom,” celebrity photographer <strong>Damon Baker</strong> quipped, while Sprouse’s <a href=#>Riverdale</a> costar <a href=#><strong>Skeet Ulrich</strong></a> thought the image was hilarious and replied with a series of crying-laughing emojis. <a href=#><strong>Mark Consuelos</strong></a>, who also stars on the CW hit, simply wrote, “Yo.”</p><p>Multiple fans compared the Five Feet Apart actor’s edited body to <a href=#>the Kardashians</a>. “Cole Kardashian,” they shared in response to the risqué upload.</p><p>Celebrities continued to chime in as well. “Them cheeks are looking COLOSSAL king🤤,” wrote <strong>Bazzi</strong>, while <a href=#><strong>Zelda Williams</strong></a> noted, “Annnnnd just as it left my consciousness, it’s back again 😂.” Ugly Betty alum <strong>Mark Indelicato</strong> added, “This photo has been in my favorites for a very long time so I’m glad you posted before I did.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Cole-Sprouse-Goes-Nude-Seemingly-Photoshopped-Pic-Flaunts-Bare-Butt-0004.jpg><p>Sprouse is known for his deadpan sense of humor, particularly on social media. He even has <a href=#>a separate Instagram account</a> dedicated solely to catching when fans try and sneak photos of him.</p><p>The Big Daddy actor — whose breakout role was playing Cody Martin on the early 2000s Disney Channel series The Suite Life of Zack and Cody (alongside twin brother <a href=#><strong>Dylan Sprouse</strong></a>) — often finds his personal life in the spotlight, particularly due to his romantic relationships.</p><p>Cole dated Riverdale costar <a href=#><strong>Lili Reinhart</strong></a> on and off for three years before <a href=#>the couple decided to split for good</a> in March 2020, much to the disappointment of their fans.</p><p>“Lili and I initially separated in January of this year, deciding to more permanently split in March,” the Friends alum wrote via Instagram in August 2020, adding, “What an incredible experience I had, I’ll always feel lucky and cherish that I had the chance to fall in love. I wish her nothing but the utmost love and happiness moving forward. All I’ll say about it, anything else you hear doesn’t matter.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For her part, Reinhart, 25, spoke more candidly about<a href=#> the aftermath of the breakup</a> that same month. “It was f–king rough, and there’s no other way through it than just through it,” she told Refinery29, noting, “I … just dealt with my s—t. I had to face my own pain head-on.”</p><p>Since then, both CW stars have moved onto new romances. Cole has been <a href=#>dating model <strong>Ari Fournier</strong> </a>since 2021, while the Chemical Hearts actress has been linked to <strong>Spencer Neville</strong> after they were <a href=#>spotted together at Coachella</a> in April.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGacp5yaerS80aisrJ1dnLymv4ynrJ2dXaiyprnIp56lsV2ltbDAzqyfqKijYq%2B2wNNmoKdlnqizuHnPoaatp18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
