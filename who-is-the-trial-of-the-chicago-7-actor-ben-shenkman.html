For example, movies like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast and Furious 9</a>, John Wick 4, Black Widow, and Top Gun: Maverick were all supposed to come out in 2020 but they won’t be released until 2012 at the earliest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At first blush, there is nothing good about the fact that so many highly anticipated movies have yet to come out as of this writing. However, there may have a silver lining in the end. After all, if all of those blockbuster movies had been released, it is likely that many of the films that come out in 2020 would largely have been ignored. After all, if moviegoers were busy watching wild action scenes in the cinemas, a smaller movie like The Trial of the Chicago 7 would have come and gone without much fanfare.</p><p>Easily one of the best movies of the year, The Trial of the Chicago 7 told a compelling story that captivated most of the people who watched it. On top of that, The Trial of the Chicago 7 introduced a lot of people to Ben Shenkman, an extremely talented actor who deserves a lot more credit. Now that more people have become aware of who Shenkman is, it only makes sense to take a closer look at his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look: John Wick 4 Gets Delayed By A Year</a></span></p><h2 id=shenkman-s-early-life>Shenkman’s Early Life</h2><p>Born and raised in New York City, Ben Shenkman attended Brown University before transferring to New York University's Graduate Acting Program at the Tisch Schoof of the Arts. Once Shenkman graduated, it didn’t take him too long to make his acting debut. Like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a lot of actors</a>, Shenkman landed a supporting role in a 1993 episode of Law & Order. After that, Shenkman debuted on the big screen when he landed a small role in the 1994 movie Quiz Show.</p><p>Once Ben Shenkman made his big and little screen debuts, he may have thought that the roles would start to roll in. Unfortunately for him, however, it wasn’t until 1996 that Shenkman found another television or movie role, and even then he only landed bit roles. Fortunately, in 1998 Shenkman caught a break in the most unlikely of places.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Ben Shenkman landed one of the main roles in a microbudget movie called Pi, there was no way he could have known that the film would go on to achieve a surprising degree of success. A wholly original film that was directed by Darren Aronofsky, a director that has since become a force in Hollywood, Pi would receive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rave reviews</a> and make a very healthy profit. Once people in the industry took note of Pi’s success, it didn’t take long for Shenkman’s career to turn around.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence Has This To Say About Her Exes</a></span></p><h2 id=momentum-gains>Momentum Gains</h2><p>By the time the 2000s dawned, Ben Shenkman was starting to find regular acting work in the business. For example, years after Shenkman made his debut in an episode of Law & Order, he was cast as a recurring character that appeared in six episodes of the very same show. Remarkably enough, Shenkman also appeared as two more characters in Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and Law & Order: Trial by Jury during the early-2000s.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, Ben Shenkman’s career during the 2000s wasn’t made up entirely of appearances in the Law & Order franchise. Instead, Shenkman began to win critical praise for the first time during that period. For example, Shenkman’s stellar acting in a play called “Proof” impressed enough people that he was nominated for a Tony Award in 2001.</p><p>Most notably, Ben Shenkman really put himself on the map for the first time when he played one of the main roles in the 2003 HBO miniseries Angels in America. Considering that Angels in America starred major actors like Meryl Streep, Al Pacino, and Emma Thompson, it says an awful lot that Shenkman was cast in such an important role in the same series. Thankfully for everyone involved, Shenkman’s Angels in America performance was so impressive that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he was nominated</a> for a Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe. Considering that the Golden Globes always is one of the most <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">star-studded</a> awards shows of the year, it was amazing to see Shenkman included at that table.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Best And Worst Dressed From The Golden Globes</a></span></p><h2 id=taking-things-to-another-level>Taking Things To Another Level</h2><p>After Ben Shenkman was nominated for a Golden Globe, he failed to become a major movie or television star. However, that would still mark a turning point in Shenkman’s career as he would go on to become one of the most in-demand character actors in the business. In fact, most people have likely seen Shenkman’s work in the past. After all, Shenkman had roles in movies like Just Like Heaven and Blue Valentine and he showed up in many shows including Burn Notice and Drop Dead Diva.</p><p>Over the last decade, Ben Shenkman’s career has been dominated by TV shows. Fortunately, that is a really good thing as he has landed recurring roles in many beloved shows including Grey’s Anatomy, Damages, The Night Of, and Curb Your Enthusiasm. More importantly, Shenkman has landed lead roles in shows like Royal Pains and Billions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite everything Ben Shenkman has accomplished, there are very strong arguments for the idea that his most notable role to date is the one he played in The Trial of the Chicago 7. Thankfully for him, Shenkman did himself proud as he was so good in that movie that it wouldn’t be shocking if he wound up in the running for major awards.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Is Sacha Baron Cohen Better As Borat Or 'Trail Of Chicago 7's' Abbie Hoffman?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuwMeeZK2qmZa5brvFZquhnV2YtaqvwKCmZm9dlrC1u9FmmZ6mXai1prrKppinZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
