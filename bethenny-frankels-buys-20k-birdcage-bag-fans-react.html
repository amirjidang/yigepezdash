In her “first real unboxing” video, Frankel gushed over <a href=#>the eccentric bag</a>: “Look how pretty! It’s a very special piece.” The accessory features a gold metal enclosure, crystal and stone embellishments and two metallic birds perched on a bar. Inside, there was a black velvet pouch that can “hold your cell phone,” and the clutch was finished with a chic strap.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Bethenny-Frankel-Fans-Have-Strong-Thoughts-About-Her-20000-Chanel-Birdcage-Bag-2.jpg><p>Frankel went on to justify her purchase, saying, “What we did sell ourselves on is that it’s a piece of art. You could leave this on a coffee table … There were very few that were ever made in the world.”</p><p>Frankel continued, explaining that her fiancé, <a href=#><strong>Paul Bernon</strong></a>, “likes things that are very unique and special … He likes collectible items, so he always asks me ‘Is this a major bag alert?’”</p><p>Frankel captioned the post: “I love SPECIAL pieces. Do you like? 🥰.”</p><p>Her fans were quick to share their candid thoughts in her comments section. One follower wrote, “As much as I love Chanel, this is the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever seen. Come on, now, even for Chanel, this is stupid.” A second user commented, “Wow, that’s absolutely horrific.” A third chimed in, “Sorry Bethany thumbs down for this one.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While some did not find the cage useful or aesthetically pleasing, others recognized how luxurious the clutch was. <a href=#><strong>La La Kent</strong></a> wrote, “She’s absolutely gorgeous. The birdcage bag is pretty too. For real tho… stunnnnnning. Obsessed.” Fashion expert <strong>Jenna Rennert</strong> commented, “Proud to say I witnessed this insane gorgeous purchase🙌🔥 wear in good health!!!!”</p><p>Although Frankel balled out for the famous bag, she is known to regularly review expensive items and share beauty dupes for a more affordable lifestyle. In May 2023, she <a href=#>took to Instagram</a> to review the Valmont Moisturizing with a Creme — which retails for $200 — and compared it to Nivea Creme — which only costs $2. After testing both products, she preferred the more affordable cream: “This is a more hydrated side … The Nivea side is more supple. You should try this!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5eytbTEp6WyZZanrq%2B3xKWqZpqlrsBufo%2BkZJuhopmworPEZpman12brq%2B%2FjKucmpukZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
