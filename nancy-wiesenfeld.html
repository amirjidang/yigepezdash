The two met somewhere in 1977 via mutual friends and started dating. After a year of togetherness, they finally exchanged their vows on the 17th of December, 1978. The ceremony was held in a private place surrounded by loved ones. Nancy was just 18 at the time of her marriage.</p><p>The lovely duo spent twenty years as a married couple. During this time, Wiesenfeld attended many high-profile public events and red carpets together. The couple was very envy-worthy, and people got very much stocked on their long and inspiring relationship. It seemed like the two were destined to complement each other for the rest of their lives.</p><p>Sadly, Wiesenfeld filed for divorce in April 2003 due to several misunderstandings. The case was supervised by the Los Angeles Superior Court and finalized on the 10th of December, 2004. Infidelity and several sexual harassment cases against the businessman are the primary catalysts for the marriage breakup. The media covered the whole divorce scene because Moonves was the reigning CEO of CBS Corporation.</p><p>Although the marriage could not pass the test of time, the couple shares three beautiful children as their only connection now. They welcomed their first child on the 26th of November, 1984. She is none other than Sara Moonves and currently works as a style director for the “W” Magazine. Following this event, Nancy gave birth to her twin sons, Adam and Michael, on the 9th of February, 1988.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Some_Famous_Profile><strong>Some Famous Profile</strong></span></h3><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Her_Ex-Husband_Les_Moonves_Bio><strong>Her Ex-Husband Les Moonves Bio</strong></span></h3><p>Les is a media executive famous for his position as the chairman of the CBS Corporation.

She shared her side of the story that happened in 1995.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><span id=Both_Have_Moved_On>Both Have Moved On</span></h4><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.webofbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Nancy-Wiesenfeld-Husband.jpg><p>Despite the painful marriage crumble, Nancy and her ex-husband Les have moved on. Nancy is married to another man and lives peacefully in Los Angeles. Details about her new spouse are unclear, though.</p><p>On the other hand, Les had his backup plans before his divorce from Nancy. Sources reveal that the businessman had been involved in extramarital affairs with Julie Chen. The two had encountered each other when Les was still the president of CBS Company and had been dating under the shadows.</p><p>The whole thing is unclear, but reportedly, Nancy got very hurt with the news. She even shared with the New York Daily about her disappointment with the situation. She said</p><p>I was uncomfortable coming to New York.
