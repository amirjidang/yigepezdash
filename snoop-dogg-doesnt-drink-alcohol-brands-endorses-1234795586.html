It’s like, ni**a, you don’t pay me to drink it, you pay me to promote it. So I’m not here to get drunk. I’m here to get money.” The rapper doubled-down on his sentiments in the video’s comments section, writing, “I’m not here to get drunk im here to get money.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1483164794.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Over the course of his career, Snoop has served as a pitchman for several liquor, wine, and beer brands. Included among them are St. Ides, INDOGGO Gin, and Happy Dad. In 2020, he <a href=#>inked a multi-year deal </a>with Australian winery&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>19 Crimes</a>&nbsp;owned by Treasury Wine Estates to release a bottle dubbed Snoop Cali Red. The hitmaker is also currently an ambassador for Corona and has appeared in commercial’s opposite Karol G and Andy Samberg.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">In 2015, <a href=#>Snoop sued Pabst</a>, alleging that he was entitled to a portion of profits from a reported $700 million sale of the company, but never received payment. In defense, Pabst argued that the deal wasn’t a sale, but a mere change in stock ownership of its parent company. The two sides eventually settled their dispute prior to the case going to trial.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Watch Snoop Dogg’s interview with Tiffany Haddish below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6i7sLvPZpuon5disbCx0qerZpyinrusecClmqign6F6o77Ap5usZZWjsbC%2B0p6qZmliaIF4hZRub29n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
