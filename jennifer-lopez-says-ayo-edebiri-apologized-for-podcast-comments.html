She was just like, ‘I’m so f—king sorry, it was so awful of me.’”</p><p>Lopez also <a href=#>waved off Edebiri’s “funny” comments</a> about her music. “I’ve heard similar things said about me throughout my career, so it really didn’t affect me,” she added.</p><p>Edebiri originally came under fire earlier this month when a clip from her 2020 appearance on <strong>Laci Mosley</strong>’s “Scam Goddess” podcast resurfaced. During the episode, Edebiri made several jokes about Lopez’s career being “one long scam.”</p><p>“Well, that’s the thing. She thinks she’s on multiple tracks, but it’s not her. I think she thinks that she’s still good even though she’s not singing for most of these songs,” she quipped. “A lot of the write-ups of the songs will be like, ‘J. Lo didn’t have time to make it to the studio,’ like J. Lo was busy. It’s like, ‘Doing what?’ Not singing, obviously!”</p><p>The commentary went viral just one day before Edebiri was <a href=#>set to share the stage with Lopez</a> during her hosting debut.</p><p>Edebiri ultimately <a href=#>addressed the drama in a sketch</a> where she and SNL cast members <strong>Chloe Fineman </strong>and<strong> Andrew Dismukes</strong> played game show contestants who were asked to explain why they wrote mean messages on social media.</p><p>After Edebiri’s character wrote “die” in the comments of one of <strong>Drew Barrymore</strong>’s posts, she attempted to make amends.</p><p>“OK, OK, We get it. It’s wrong to leave mean comments or post comments just for clout — or run your mouth on a podcast and you don’t consider the impact because you’re 24 and stupid,” she said. “But, I think I speak for everyone when I say, from now on, we’re going to be a lot more thoughtful about what we post online.”</p><p>Edebiri also praised Lopez’s performance later that night. (Lopez sang “This Is Me… Now” and “Can’t Get Enough” as the musical guest on SNL.)</p><p>“Thank you to Jennifer Lopez,” the actress said during the closing segment. “Thank you so much, this has been a dream come true. I love you, goodnight!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Bear star has since <a href=#>poked fun at the drama by responding</a> to <strong>Tina Fey</strong>‘s take on the situation. During the Wednesday, February 6, episode of the “Las Culturistas” podcast, Fey, 53, used Edebiri as an example while telling cohosts <strong>Bowen Yang</strong> and <strong>Matt Rogers</strong> why they shouldn’t publicly share their critical opinions.</p><p>“Are you having a problem with Saltburn? Quiet luxury. Keep it to yourself,” Fey said in a clip, which Yang reposted on his Instagram. “Because what are you going to do when [Saltburn director] <strong>Emerald Fennell</strong> calls you about her next project where you play<strong> Carey Mulligan</strong>’s coworker in the bridal section of Harrods, and then Act 3 takes a sexually violent turn, and you have to pretend to be surprised by that turn? Learn from my mistakes, learn from Ayo. Podcasts are forever. Authenticity is dangerous and expensive.”</p><p>In the comments section, Edebiri replied, “LEARN FROM ME.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0WajqKiVr3q0rdisZJqxn2KypbHBoqmiZZGlvK27xqKxnpxdm7yzec%2Bom5yZo6l6pLvMppynrKNk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
