I missed that so much.”</p><p>In the slideshow, a photo showed Kaitlin holding Lucy in the hospital hallway in addition to one of Jordi, 42, cradling his baby girl in the hospital room. The couple’s daughters Riley, 10, and Everly, 7, also made posters to welcome their little sister home.</p><p>Kaitlin continued by sharing her and Jordi’s appreciation for the entire hospital staff who helped them care for their daughter.</p><p>“We are forever grateful for how well you took care of our girl. More on that when I’m a little less PTSDish, but forever grateful for the intelligence and compassion of each person who cared for her — especially her ICU nurses who are angels taking care of baby angels day in and day out,” she penned. “I have so much more to say about that, but for now, holding each and every child and family within those walls (and each and every person taking care of them) in our hearts.”</p><p>The actress also shouted out the pair’s friends for the love they sent their way while Lucy was in the hospital.</p><p>“Thank you again, friends. For loving on us like you do and loving this baby girl!” she concluded. “Praying things are boring around here for a while and I am just posting happy baby/family updates.. 😅🙏🏻.”</p><p>Jordi and Kaitlin announced in January that Lucy, who was born on December 31, 2023, was rushed to the hospital after having “difficulty breathing” and subsequently diagnosed with RSV. While in the hospital, the baby’s condition worsened and she was <a href=# rel=noopener>admitted into the NICU</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Last night, things unexpectedly took a turn for the worse and she was moved to NICU [with] what the doctors described as a partially collapsed right lung,” Kaitlin wrote via Instagram at the time. “I am still struggling to believe this as I type. Please please pray with us for miraculous healing for Lucy’s precious little body. We love her so much and just want her home and happy and in our arms.”</p><p>Kaitlin’s sister, <strong>Bailee Madison</strong>, visited her niece while she was in the hospital and thanked her followers for all their support during the difficult moment for her family.</p><p>“Hi everyone. Thank you so much for your overwhelming love for Lucy and all the love you have sent to @kaitlinvilasuso & @jordivilasuso,” Madison, 34, captioned the clip. “To say we are grateful would be an understatement. Lucy is still being her beautiful tough cookie self. Thank you for helping bring us all peace during these days.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGayp6WjtG6tzZ1kraCVYr%2Bmv9OlnKyrXZ%2B8s7DIZq2ipJGowrS70mabmq2XncGmvoyhpqadXZu%2FsLmMp6CcrV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
