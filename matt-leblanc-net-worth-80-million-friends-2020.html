But where has his money been coming from as of late?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=matt-leblanc-s-fortune>Matt LeBlanc’s Fortune</h2><p>After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">earning roughly $18 million</a> from the final series of Friends, LeBlanc was quick to book his next project, Joey, which only lasted for two seasons, and though it was never disclosed how much he made from the short-lived spinoff, it’s believed that the numbers would have been anywhere between $500,000 to $750,000 per episode.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends: How Much Did Jennifer Aniston Get Paid For The Show?</a></span></p><p>In 2006, Joey concluded after 46 episodes. He took a lengthy break from acting for unknown reasons, but by 2010, LeBlanc took on a new role in filmmaking: executive producing. His first commercial film was Jonah Hex, starring Megan Fox, Michael Fassbender, and Josh Brolin, before going on to produce the TV movie The Prince in 2015.</p><p>2011 brought upon yet another TV show for the likable star who played himself in the Showtime series Episodes, which was undoubtedly the most successful run for LeBlanc since the end of Friends, running for six years and producing a total of five seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2013, LeBlanc joined former Friends co-star Lisa Kudrow on her comedy show Web Therapy, playing Nick Jericho for five episodes before landing the role of Charlie Darby in 2014’s Lovesick.</p><p>In 2016, the Massachusetts native executive produced and starred in the CBS television show Man with a Plan - again, it’s unclear how much money he was earning for each project behind the camera, but it’s fair to assume that he certainly wasn’t making less than what he’s worth based on his credentials and star power.</p><p>In May 2020, however, the network announced it had canceled the show after four seasons - it was later reported that while the final season achieved satisfactory ratings, it still wasn’t enough to keep it running based on the production costs that came with hiring major stars like LeBlanc himself.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What’s Jennifer Aniston’s Real Name?
