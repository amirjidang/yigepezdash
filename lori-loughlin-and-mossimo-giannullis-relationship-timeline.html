Loughlin and Giannulli’s two daughters, <strong>Bella</strong> and<a href=#><strong> Olivia Jade</strong></a>, attended the school, but Us Weekly confirmed in October 2019 that they were no longer enrolled.</p><p>The bribe money was donated to <strong>William Rick Singer</strong>’s fake charity, and <a href=#>CNN</a> reported that Giannulli had sent a friendly email to the man behind the scam about their eldest daughter’s excitement to be admitted into the University of Southern California.</p><p>“I wanted to thank you again for your great work with [our daughter], she is very excited and both Lori and I are very appreciative of your efforts and end result!” an alleged email from Giannulli to Singer read.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hours after news broke of the scam, <a href=#>Giannulli was arrested</a>&nbsp;and later let go on a $1 million bond. The When Calls the Heart star, for her part, was “out of the country” and was <a href=#>taken into custody</a> the following day. She too had bail set at $1 million. They pleaded not guilty to fraud and money laundering charges before accepting a plea deal and serving time behind bars.</p><p>Scroll down to take a look back at Loughlin and Giannulli’s relationship timeline.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkubC%2ByGajqK2XnbmquoyapZ1lnaTAtLXMqGSgoZGju7a4y6KqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
