Chris Hemsworth rose to superstardom after joining the <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) </a>and being cast as Thor. Meanwhile, Matt Damon took his first Oscar win early on in his career, after writing (alongside buddy Ben Affleck) <a href=#>and starring in the critically acclaimed film Good Will Hunting</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Matt Damon's Real Hollywood Feuds (That Weren't With Jimmy Kimmel)</a></span></p><p>And while the two men have briefly worked together in the past (Damon made a surprising cameo in one of Hemsworth’s Thor films), fans aren’t aware of the what the relationship between the two actors is really like.</p><h2 id=they-met-while-chris-hemsworth-was-starting-out-in-hollywood>They Met While Chris Hemsworth Was Starting Out In Hollywood</h2><p>When Hemsworth first came to Hollywood, he was a relatively unknown actor up until he made his Marvel debut. That said, one can say that he was already well-connected at that time. In fact, one of the actors that he became friends with immediately was none other than Damon himself. According to People, Hemsworth and his wife, actress Elsa Pataky, met the Oscar winner through a mutual friend.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>An Inside Look At Chris Hemsworth And Isla Fisher's Relationship</a></span></p><p>“We became friends around the time I started to work, and I’ve really benefited from watching how he handles himself,” Hemsworth told GQ in 2014. “Matt’s just a normal guy who has the movie-star thing figured out.” In fact, when the Aussie actor did this particular interview, Damon even lent him and GQ reporter David Katz his mountain bikes. Damon even accompanied the men on their bike ride, although he drove his Tesla.</p><h2 id=matt-damon-once-referred-to-chris-hemsworth-as-his-lsquo-support-system-rsquo>Matt Damon Once Referred To Chris Hemsworth As His ‘Support System’</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After years of knowing each other, Hemsworth has become a part of Damon’s inner circle. In fact, back in 2017, after Damon lost his father and also came under fire after comments he made during an interview, he decided to go under the radar and fly to Australia with his family (at the suggestion of <a href=#>his wife, Luciana Barroso</a>).</p><p>Around that time, Hemsworth understood that Damon just needed a break for a while. “The whole Hemsworth family and all of their friends, we’re close with all of them,” Damon said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent GQ interview</a>. “And they were just a huge support system for us.”</p><h2 id=they-like-to-vacation-together-with-their-families>They Like To Vacation Together With Their Families</h2><p>During happier times, one can also expect the Damons and the Hemsworths together. After all, the two families love to vacation as a group. After all, both families have young kids and it turns out that they have similar preferences as far as vacations go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Are All Of The Guardians Of The Galaxy In Thor 4?</a></span></p><p>“We have three kids, they have four kids, so we ended up making the same plans because everything we do we do with the kids, so it’s easier to do things with people that understand you,” Pataky explained. “And they’re very adventurous too, so we were just on holiday in Costa Rica. We told them about it and they went and loved it and then we went together and had a great time and we’ve become really really good friends.”</p><p>At the same time, vacation plans between the Hemsworths and Damons also extend to holidays. “The [Damons] came here for Christmas and we were all together and it was a really inspirational time,” Pataky once revealed. “We got together and we felt like we had to have something to remind us of those great moments we stayed together, and we decided to get a little tattoo [of three dots on their pinkies] all together and we say ‘We’ll have to do one every year.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-hemsworth-got-matt-damon-to-do-the-thor-ragnarok-cameo>Chris Hemsworth Got Matt Damon To Do The Thor: Ragnarok Cameo</h2><p>As fans may have guessed, having Damon has a close buddy also comes with filming-specific advantages. For starters, Hemsworth can certainly count on the Bourne star to come out and take part in a Thor film, even if the role is just a cameo. In fact, all it took to make that happen was a simple phone call.</p><p>“Chris just called me up, and Taika called me up, and I'm friends with those guys,” Damon confirmed while<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> speaking with Collider</a>. “They pitched me the idea and I just thought it was hysterical, the idea of basically an intergalactic community theater actor kind of living out Tom Hiddleston's character's fantasy. I just thought it was just a great, funny bit, and very easy to do. Those guys were a lot of fun, and Taika runs a really fun set. It was a light lift for me.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, Damon was also spotted on the set of the upcoming Marvel film, Thor: Love and Thunder. In the midst of a global pandemic, the Oscar winner agreed to join them once again, so long as he could fly in with his family. “There were government officials who called me and explained to me in no uncertain terms: The only reason you’re getting in is because this production is creating jobs,” he recalled. While production was underway, Damon and Hemsworth were pictured together a few times. As expected, the buddies looked to be having a good time.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Chris Hemsworth Confessed That He Made This Mistake While Playing Thor</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6rq3TrWSdmZ2ku26tzZ1knKCinsButMSmqrCnoqm1tHnRnqOarJmku7S0yKlm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
