The talk show icon, 59, and 80s actress, 52, costarred in 1985's The Color Purple, and Chong looked back on her dynamic with Winfrey in a shocking chat with Matty P’s Radio Happy Hour laced with expletives and shocking references to slavery.</p><p>While Winfrey was "lovely" on the set of the <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>'s film, Chong recalled, Winfrey became a "total biotch" when Chong landed a role in <a href=#><strong>Arnold Schwarzenneger</strong></a>'s action film Commando. "She just wasn't having me," Chong, the daughter of comic actor Tommy Chong, said. "She's competitive. She didn't like me."</p><p>During her rant — first unearthed by <a href=#>TMZ</a> — Chong then called Winfrey a "great brownnoser. If you go into a room with her she will pick the most powerful person and will become best friends with them. . . Whe was the fat chick in school that did everything and everyone loved her. That's Oprah."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Continuing to slam Winfrey's appearance, she added, "If you look at the way [Oprah] looks, she looks like 60 years ago she would have been a house keeper luckily." In her most disturbing insult, she added that Winfrey would have been a "house [n-word] back in the slave days."</p><p>Despite the slew of insults, the Soul Man actress wrapped up her chat with a compliment. "We have to give her props. This woman is a miracle and I respect her and I say kudos to you, and I don't give two cents about the other parts of it. She shifted the DNA in terms of our thinking of a woman of a certain size and a certain shade. I love her for that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGarmZVisaLDzWaaoaeenHq0uMCmqmanoKeuqXnWoqWfqpWueqW%2BzqmqZqZdrLyzsIyipWaumZi2sMHSZqmapqRif3F9kmpwcGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
