During her stint on the reality TV show Mob Wives, their rocky and complicated marriage was often in the limelight. It was later shown in the show that they had put their differences aside and had gotten back together. However, he was soon arrested and had decided to give evidence against her father, Anthony Graziano. He was equipped with a secret wire recorder and had taped her father as a part of the undercover Drug Enforcement Administration probe. She was left devastated by her husband’s actions. Soon after, their marriage collapsed for good. They have a son together named AJ Pagan.</p>More about Renee Graziano and Hector Pagan, Jr. Less about Renee Graziano and Hector Pagan, Jr.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoqZ6mlZp6qL7As6Capp9irq%2BwjKGcnKyfp3qxrcaapWaiog%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
