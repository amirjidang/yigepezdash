He said that Logan’s company scammed investors by convincing them to poor money into worthless digital assets.</p><p>Logan first launched CryptoZoo in 2021, after teasing the idea on his podcast. He claims to have <a href=#>spent a million dollars developing the app</a>, which allows users to buy NFTs and cryptocurrencies in an attractive, interactive game format.</p><p>Users were promised they could easily make money through the online platform, however, it received criticism when no playable features were incorporated by 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amid reports that he sold millions of dollars in cryptocurrency and NFTs via CryptoZoo, Logan has allegedly abandoned the project.</p><p>The backlash against CryptoZoo was at an all-time high after Coffeezilla’s first video was released, which prompted Logan to make an apology in the company’s Discord channel. He said CryptoZoo would be "taking accountability, apologising and coming forward with a plan in the near future."</p><p>Furthermore<a href=#>, Logan deleted the video in which he threatened</a> to sue Coffeezilla, and also issued and apology to the online investigator.</p><p>Coffeezilla subsequently posted on his own social media channels confirming Logan’s apology and revealing what was next, as far as he knew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“ <a href=#>Logan called me,”</a> Coffeezilla tweeted. “Taking accountability, apologising and coming forward with a plan in the near future.”</p><p>The YouTuber added, “I believe he’s making a 3rd response, which I’ll be delaying my video to include. Hopefully this time he takes accountability and refunds the victims of CryptoZoo. That’s what matters.”</p><p>It's not clear what prompted Logan to backtrack on his threats to sue Coffeezilla, or to apologize for CryptoZoo, after weeks of staying silent on the controversial platform.</p><p>He may have avoided one lawsuit, but Logan is no stranger to the court room. He’s been the subject of various lawsuits over the year. Perhaps most infamously, <a href=#>Logan was sued after posting a video in Japan’s “Suicide Forest,”</a> in which he mocked a dead body while showing it on camera.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Malu Trevejo’s Ex-Employees File $4 Million Lawsuit Over Alleged Abuse</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>BBC</a>, <a href=#>Coin Telegraph</a>, <a href=#>NBC</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS5sLPAp2SpmaWheqK8zqWmoKGqmsBuss6rZK2gopqutbHNoqWgZZyWxLTByK1kqK6Vp3qkvtipq6iyn6R6tK%2FApmScpJGeurR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
