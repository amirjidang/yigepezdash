To the point where he says he will never stray from your lead. What makes your bond with him so tight?</strong><br>I’ve been with Drake since the very beginning of his career [when] I didn’t produce anything. I didn’t produce one fucking thing on “Come Back Season” except the intro… that wasn’t my role. When we started looking for this music and he was turning down hundreds of beats, I realized what sound he was going for. So I said, ‘Fuck it, I might as well do it.’ I didn’t have a reason to make beats until then. It’s that coupled with the fact that I control all of Drake’s music. I have all of his drives and his entire catalogue from day one. No one has ever touched his sessions. So at the end of the day the responsibility of A&Ring his projects has always been mine— whether I was producing it or not. So producing became an easy progression. We have a great level of trust because I’ve been doing it since day one. Most engineers suffer from artists telling them what to do though they’ve never touched a fucking EQ. We have a very different dynamic. Even if I don’t produce something I put a twist on it to make sure it fits. None of this was premeditated. Drake is super spoiled. The bastard won’t work with anyone else. I will track him ‘til the day I die.<br><strong><br>Would you say this sound has been tailored specifically for Drake?</strong><br>At this point in time the only rappers I have any interest in working with outside of Drake are Wayne and [Jay-Z]. And that’s from Drake’s mouth. I think Drake has been so instrumental in creating that sound that I have a commitment to him. If he doesn’t’ want me to give it away I won’t.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is that where you and Boi-1da differ as producers?</strong><br>Very much so. 1da’s trying to place records and expand his reach in the world of hip-hop. But my ambitions are to stay focused with Drake. When it comes time to develop another artist I’ll make that move. But going after placements is definitely not my M.O. I don’t like that game. I’m not saying what 1da’s doing is wrong we’re just different that way. I’m cool where I’m at. I haven’t signed a publishing deal yet. What are publishing companies gonna do for me other than lend me money? And I have way too many friends in the hood that can lend me just as much and their interest rates are way better. Why am I gonna take money from you? If Universal Music Publishing is already working “Successful” why do I need them to work on my side? I have a very unorthodox attitude toward the whole business.</p><p><strong>Two years ago if someone said 40, they would’ve thought ounce. What’s your current state of mind now that so much has changed?<br></strong>I feel blessed. I’m a kid from Toronto. I’ve been driving my mom’s station wagon for the last 8 years for real. I’m trying to make a career for myself and not flush it down the toilet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX2l9bsDApaKsZZKktm59w5pknaGWm7Kzsc2cnKxln6O5unmSZqeep6Chsm60xKWjZq%2Bfp7huv8%2BooKWhnpx6pb7ApJxmbGNpfnN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
