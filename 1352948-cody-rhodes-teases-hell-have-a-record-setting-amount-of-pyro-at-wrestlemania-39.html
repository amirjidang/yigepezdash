There, he will challenge Roman Reigns for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amy Nemmity of WrestleJoy</a>, Rhodes was asked whether the WWE Universe can expect to see “great pyro or the greatest pyro,” and he stated that you have to go big at WrestleMania. He then noted that, even when he was an executive in AEW, he never asked for pyro, but he got so much of it that it became a gag.</p><p>“Oh my gosh. I would have to say, you want to go with the latter, go with the greatest. At this point, I’m gonna be honest, I never asked anybody for pyro. Even in AEW when I was running things, I never asked anybody for pyro, and then it became like a running gag, the amount of pyro, and now it’s not even that, it’s just part of the experience.</p><p>“It’s like the fireworks at Magic Kingdom. You know, this happens at this time and they legit blow up the sky. I think with a WrestleMania on the west coast, in Hollywood, it’s the biggest display that’s ever been done involving a ring. I don’t think greatest can even cover it. I really don’t. I think you’re looking at a record setting amount of pyro.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of WWE WrestleMania 39 as it airs on April 1 and 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJuaXJsaGKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG7AxJqqnqtdnbKtuIyhmK%2BdXZZ6s7HCqKmdZaOawbW1zaBkmqWfqru1ec6fZKmxoqR6osCMsKmeq6Shsq6tzaKYZmtp</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
