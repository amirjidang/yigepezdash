In 1964, he guest-starred in “The Enormous Fist” episode of “Rawhide” opposite Eric Fleming and Clint Eastwood. That year, he also appeared as the title character Michael Manning, alias Michael Da Vinci, in the Perry Mason episode, “The Case of the Careless Kidnapper”.</p><p>In the 1965–1966 television season, Slade played Radioman Patrick Hollis in the NBC sitcom, The Wackiest Ship in the Army.</p><p>In 1966, at the age of 27, he obtained one of his most memorable parts, as Billy Blue Cannon, the blond-haired, blue-eyed son of the ranch patriarch, John Cannon (Leif Erickson) on The High Chaparral, set in the Arizona Territory. The series aired for four seasons. In the same year, he was cast in an episode of the western TV series Bonanza as Jud Rickman.</p><p>He went on to play Taylor Reed in the 1973 film Salty and reprised his role in the syndicated adventure series Salty (1974–1975). Slade’s acting career continued into the early 1990s. He made more than 300 appearances on stage, screen, and television.
