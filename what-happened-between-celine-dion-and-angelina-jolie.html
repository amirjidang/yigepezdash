She has been busy on charities and politics on top of being a great mother to her kids. With her divorce proceedings going on at that time, she wanted to be with her kids as much as possible to avoid some trauma of the breakup.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=celine-dion-rsquo-s-reaction-after-angelina-jolie-rejected-the-film-offer>Celine Dion’s Reaction After Angelina Jolie Rejected The Film Offer</h2><p>It was reported that the singer was apparently distraught after hearing that Angelina Jolie turned down the offer to play Celine Dion in a film.

She even told Elle magazine: “I am like a one-year-old! I’m not saying that I don’t care what people think of me, but I’ve reached a point in my life where I can let myself make my own decisions and choices."</p><p>The then 51-year-old singer further added “Now I am discovering myself more and more. I am a woman assuming her own destiny, full of energy and in love with life. It’s never too late to start.
