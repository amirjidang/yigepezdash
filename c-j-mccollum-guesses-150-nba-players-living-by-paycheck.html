Commissioner Adam Silver doesn't believe a decision will be made before May.</p><p>Over the weekend, it was reported that the league wants to cut player salaries by 50 percent. The NBPA offered a 25 percent reduction in player salaries.</p><p>And it's hard to imagine players accepting the NBA's proposal of 50 percent salary reductions, especially when you consider the recent comments by Portland Trail Blazers star C.J. McCollum.</p><p>In an interview with ESPN's Jay Williams,&nbsp;McCollum suggested that 150 of 450 NBA players "are living paycheck to paycheck." You can watch the full interview below.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA, NHL & MLB May Lose $1 Billion In Ad Spending Amid Covid-19 Pandemic</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>McCollum suggested that some of these players could have "loaned money or paid money to family." As McCollum pointed out, nobody saw the current situation playing out. The 2016 Most Improved Player award winner has donated $170,000 for COVID-19 relief in both Portland and Canton, Ohio.</p><p>The 28-year-old&nbsp;McCollum signed a three-year contract extension worth $100 million last offseason, after helping Portland make a surprise run to the Western Conference Final. They were eventually swept by the dynastic Golden State Warriors. Before the 2019-20 season went on pause, Portland was ninth in the Western Conference with a 29-37 record, 3.5 games behind the Memphis Grizzlies for the final playoff spot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like the NBA, it is unknown if the NHL or MLS will resume their 2019-20 seasons. MLB is looking at a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plan that could see the season begin in May</a>, and the NFL draft which runs from Apr. 23 to 25 - will be come in a "virtual" format. The regular season is currently scheduled to begin in September, but there's a chance that the league may be forced to push the start of the 2020 campaign back.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL Quarterbacks Have Signed Contracts Worth $900 Million In Past Year</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6tom12feq6vwqijpa2dYrS2sdKsnKxlYWp9brrBmmSppJGusrO%2FjKWgr6GenHqjxYypmLKbmJqwrHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
