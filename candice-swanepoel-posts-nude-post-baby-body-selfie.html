Oh and the only thing she was wearing was her earring with her&nbsp;signature golden blonde strands swept into a top knot. And because her snapshot was so smoldering, of course the supermodel didn’t have to caption it — she left it all to a simple selfie hand emoji.</p><p>Candice has been refreshingly candid about her journey from pregnancy to getting back into shape, as she was after her first child was born. Just last week, the 29-year-old model fired back at criticism of her body when she was photographed wearing a bikini twelve days after having her baby.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>To put it simply, Swanepoel told her critics that if they had something to say about her body, they could check themselves at the door. “I’m not ashamed to show my post-partum tummy.&nbsp; I am proud actually, I carried my son for 9 months in there. I think I’ve earned the right to have a little tummy.” She continued, “Is it because I’m a model? Well we are normal people too, so let me enjoy the beach in peace please.”</p><p>Well, if that didn’t silence her critics, Swanepoel’s latest selfie surely will. She’s a new mom times two who is proud of what her body can do — and she’s not going to hide it just because it doesn’t look exactly how it did before she was pregnant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5iur7DInJxmq6eWu6a8zp6jZqifqMG0ec2um55loKTAtXnBmpmyZZKksbp50p6jn6GVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
