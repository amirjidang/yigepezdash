Michael Stipe was born January 4, 1960 in Decatur, Georgia. He is best known as the lead singer of the alternative rock band R.E.M. since their formation (1980) through their breakup (2011). Stipes met Peter Buck, Bill Berry and Mike Mills while enrolled at the University of Georgia and the four formed the alternative rock band R.E.M. Known for their unique sound, the alternative rock group played their first concert in Athens, Georgia and released their debut album, Murmur, in 1983 on IRS Records. The group then moved to Warner Brothers and released 1991’s Out of Time, which included the hit single Losing My Religion. Though quiet as a child, Stipe emerged from his shell in high school, using his musicality and appreciation of punk music to his social advantage. Over the years, since R.E.M. parted ways, Stipe focused more on making art than music. Still, Stipe hasn’t abandoned music completely. He teamed up with Courtney Love for a track on the collection Son of Rogue’s Gallery: Pirate Ballads, Sea Songs and Chanteys, released in 2013. The trio officially announced that they were splitting up in 2011, the same year they released what turned out to be their final album, Collapse into Now. Aside from his success with R.E.M., in early 1987 Stipe co-founded C00 Films with Jim McKay, a mixed-media company. n 1998, he worked on Single Cell Pictures, a film production company which released several arthouse/indie movies. Stipe has also made a number of acting appearances on film and on television and voiced Schnitzel the Reindeer in the 1999 movie Olive, the Other Reindeer. He also made an appearance in the 1996 film Color of a Brisk and Leaping Day. R.E.M. was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2007.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWZmLWisctmqq2hoJrAbrrErWSwp6KptW6uyKieq5mgncZussCcq2abkaeypr6Mmq6aqpSoeqK6w2ajop6VYsC1u9GyZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
