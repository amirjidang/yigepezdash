He is so humble and polite when interviewed that it's easy to forget that he has a massive net worth as a result of his incredible music career. The fame and money haven't gone to his head, which makes it easy to celebrate all his achievements.</p><p>Post Malone gave <strong>an amazing performance at the 2024 Super Bowl</strong>, and while he continues to earn good money from his music, he also continues to showcase his love for what he does.

Everything started with his first hit song, <strong>"White Iverson</strong>," which was released in 2015. According to Grammy.com, the song was first on SoundCloud in 2015, and then it was number 14 on the Billboard Hot 100.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/post-malone-s-pit-stop-at-a-family-store-before-coachella-was-caught-by-security-cams-and-was-everything-fans-wanted.jpg><p>"White Iverson" continues to make Post Malone money today. In 2022, Billboard reported that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the song got 1 billion YouTube views</a>. Three of his other big songs ("Congratulations," "Sunflower," and "Rockstar") achieved the same milestone.</p><p>Complex.com explained that musicians can make <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">money from YouTube views</a>, but it's not quite as much as fans would expect. Musicians are paid <strong>between $1,000 and $2,000 for 1 million views</strong>. Since Post Malone has had four songs get 1 billion views on YouTube, he must have received a nice payday for that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>4:11</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/how-post-malone-s-sunflower-became-one-1b-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>How Post Malone's Sunflower Became One Of The Most Profitable Songs</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Post Malone and Swae Lee's song "Sunflower" became one of the most successful songs of the decade, and was even featured in a Spider-Man movie.</span><p>It seems likely that <strong>"Sunflower" has made Post Malone the most money</strong>.
