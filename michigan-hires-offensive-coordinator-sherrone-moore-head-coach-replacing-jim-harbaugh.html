I am excited to reward that trust.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“I have been preparing my entire coaching career for this opportunity and I can’t think of a better place to be head coach than at the University of Michigan,” <a href=#>Moore </a>continued. “We will do everything each day as a TEAM to continue the legacy of championship football that has been played at the University of Michigan for the past 144 years. Our standards will not change. We will be a tough, physical, disciplined, hungry, championship-level team that loves football and plays with passion for the game, the winged helmet and each other. We will also continue to achieve excellence off the field, in the classroom and in our communities. I am excited to start working in this new role with our players, coaches and staff.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">The day that Harbaugh’s new coaching job was announced, Michigan’s All-America guard <a href=#>Zak Zinter</a> said “No interviews needed.

The players love playing for him and being with him in the building every day.</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">“Sherrone stepped up this fall and served as the interim head coach when the program and especially the team needed him,” <a href=#>Manuel</a> added. “Sherrone handled that situation in a way that sealed my already-growing confidence in him. He didn’t make it about him, it was always about the team! We are thrilled to have Sherrone and his wife, Kelli, and the entire Moore family step into this new role for our football program and university community.”</p><p class="default__StyledText-tl066j-0 ekcqrF body-paragraph">Moore joined Harbaugh’s staff in 2018, according to <a href=#>the AP</a>.
