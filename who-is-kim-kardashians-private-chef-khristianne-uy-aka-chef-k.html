In a lot of cases, Kim has wound up in the spotlight due to <a href=#>the controversies she has been a part of</a> and in others, she has garnered attention for <a href=#>her business successes and failures</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No matter what the reasons are for the world's obsession with Kim, the fact remains that a lot of fans pay attention to everything she does. For that reason, a lot of the people that Kim interacts with also rise to fame. The perfect example of Kim making people famous has to be her family. After all, before Kim became a superstar, very few people had heard of any members of her family aside from her parents Robert Kardashian and Caitlyn Jenner.</p><p>Relatively recently, Kim once again made someone famous when her personal chef became a celebrity chef. Now that Khristianne Uy has risen to fame thanks in large part to her relationship with Kim, that has left a lot of observers wondering how much the skilled chef is worth.</p><h2 id=how-much-money-is-khristianne-uy-worth>How Much Money Is Khristianne Uy Worth?</h2><p>During an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, there was a scene that revolved around Kim Kardashian eating some cookies that were prepared by Khristianne Uy. In that sequence, Kim claimed the cookies were so delicious that she asked the chef not to make them anymore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Did I not say no to these cookies? Like, they have to be taken away. I gained 15 pounds! Like, this is a joke, I’m going to throw them in the toilet.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Kim Kardashian's Pantry, Of All Things, Has Been Making Headlines</a></span></p><p>On the one hand, some people may have thought that Kim talking about throwing out Chef K's cookies may not be a ringing endorsement. However, Kim remarking that was the only way she could resist the cookies piqued a lot of viewers' interest in the chef.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/kim-kardashian.jpg><p>Thanks to the fame that Uy garnered because of her connection to Kim, the New York Times published an article about her in 2022. In that article, Chef K revealed that Kim later apologized to her for talking about her cookies like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“She was so kind, I wish they would have aired it. 'Chef, I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to say that about your cookies — they’re great. They’re really good, I just have no self-control.'"</p><p>More importantly, the article revealed <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how Chef K's career as a personal chef took off</a>.</p><p>"It was during a stint working at BOA Steakhouse in the mid-aughts that she met her first client. From there, she started working for the director James Cameron and the American Idol creator Simon Fuller."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Many Of The Kardashians Are Actually Vegan (And What Do They Eat?)</a></span></p><p>Later during the same article, Chef K talked about some of the celebrity clients she has worked for over the years. According to Uy, Nick Jonas is “one of the sweetest gentlemen”, Ryan Seacrest is her "favorite client" and the "nicest man" and she remarked "love her" when Charlize Theron came up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/ryan-seacrest-made-a-big-mistake-co-hosting-a-game-show-with-kelly-ripa-and-it-caused-a-45-minute-delay-with-lawyers-getting-involved.jpg><p>Uy also spoke at length about what it was like to be employed by Charlie Sheen shortly after his infamous tiger blood interview and to cook for Denise Richards.</p><p>On top of working for all of those celebrities, Uy has also made other reality TV appearances. Most notably, Chef K competed in and won the first season of ABC's cooking competition show The Taste. Uy also appeared in an episode of Millionaire Matchmaker and was billed as the show's first "lesbian millionaire".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Uy has worked for so many notable names and is a former reality star, she hasn't become famous enough to be considered an A-lister yet. For that reason, it isn't shocking that publications like Forbes and celebritynetworth.com haven't reported on Chef K yet.</p><p>Thankfully, it is still possible to get an idea of the kind of money that Uy likely is worth.</p><p>According to networthpost.org, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chef K currently has an estimated $1.1 million fortune</a>. While that website isn't as credible as celebritynetworth.com or Forbes, it does give you a ballpark idea of the kind of money Chef K is likely to be worth.</p><h2 id=how-much-are-other-celebrity-chefs-worth>How Much Are Other Celebrity Chefs Worth?</h2><p>Assuming that Khristianne Uy truly is worth $1.1 million as has been reported, she clearly is a lot wealthier than the vast majority of people in the world. However, the truth is that many of Chef K's celebrity chef peers are richer than she is.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Female Celebrity Chefs Who Are Rising To Fame</a></span></p><p>According to celebritynetworth.com's <a href=#>article about the richest celebrity chefs</a>, there are several who have hundreds of times more money than chef K.</p><p>As of the time of this writing, Kimbal Musk is listed as the richest celebrity chef since he reportedly has a $500 million fortune. However, some people may not agree with his inclusion on the list since much of his fortune comes from being a major Tesla shareholder and the work Kimbal has done with his brother, Elon Musk.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/gordon-ramsay.jpg><p>On the other hand, it pretty much is crystal clear that the next person on the list qualifies as a celebrity chef. Thanks to his many restaurants, business deals, and his tenure as a TV chef, Gordon Ramsay reportedly has amassed a $220 million fortune as of this writing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Ramsay, the next celebrity chefs with the most money according to the list are Jamie Oliver and Nobu Matsuhisa, both of whom are worth $200 million. The only two other celebrity chefs who are worth at least $100 million are Wolfgang Puck who comes in at $120 million, and Rachael Ray whose fortune is said to be worth $100 million.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/rachael-ray.jpg><p>Some of the other star chefs who are worth tens of millions include Emeril Lagasse, Bobby Flay, Ina Garten, Guy Fieri, and Jose Andres. On top of all those notable names, Julia Child's estate is worth an estimated $50 million which makes sense since she was a pioneer in the celebrity chef world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut8imZKSZopmutLTImqWsZaCntret055knKCVm3qstNGiqq2hkaO7pnnUsmSao5FisKmxxWaiaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
