From her marriages to Michael Jackson and Nicolas Cage to her own successful music career, she has been a constant topic of interest for fans and media alike. However, one aspect of her life that has garnered significant attention is her relationship with her twin daughters, Finley and Harper.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The truth about Lisa Marie's relationship with her daughters is complex and multi-faceted. Firstly, she was embroiled in a custody battle with her ex-husband Michael Lockwood over their children which lasted for several years. This legal dispute not only affected Lisa Marie's personal life but also had an impact on her professional career.</p><h2 id=why-was-lisa-marie-presley-in-a-custody-battle-with-her-ex-husband-michael-lockwood>Why Was Lisa Marie Presley In A Custody Battle With Her Ex-Husband Michael Lockwood?</h2><p>One of the most controversial aspects of Lisa Marie's life has been the custody battle she had with her ex-husband. This legal dispute was not only emotionally draining for Lisa but also affected her relationship with her children.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Page Six</a>, the battle started in 2016 when Lisa filed for divorce from Michael Lockwood, citing irreconcilable differences. However, their separation quickly turned into a custody fight over their twin daughters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/does-michael-lockwood-have-a-good-relationship-with-lisa-marie-presley-s-twins-despite-a-bitter-custody-and-estate-battle_.jpg><p>The court proceedings were not an easy feat as both parties presented different stories about each other's parenting capabilities. Lisa Marie accused Lockwood of being a neglectful father, while Lockwood claimed that Lisa was struggling with her demons and was an unfit mother. The accusations made against each other were devastating and caused a lot of tension between them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Does Michael Lockwood Have A Good Relationship With Lisa Marie Presley's Twins Despite A Bitter Custody And Estate Battle?</a></span></p><p>As the custody battle dragged on in court, Lisa Marie's health deteriorated. She became physically weak due to stress and anxiety caused by the case and had to be hospitalized several times. Her mental health also took a hit as she struggled to cope with the possibility of losing custody of her children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to TMZ, Lisa Marie's cause of demise was cardiac arrest</a>. She had lost 50 pounds, and some people believe it was due to the stress not just from this trial but from her personal battles in general.</p><h2 id=what-was-lisa-marie-presley-39-s-relationship-like-with-her-twin-daughters-harper-vivienne-ann-and-finley-lockwood>What Was Lisa Marie Presley's Relationship Like With Her Twin Daughters Harper Vivienne Ann And Finley Lockwood?</h2><p>Throughout the years, Lisa Marie has had a tumultuous relationship with her twin daughters Finley and Harper. The media has often portrayed their relationship as strained, with rumors of arguments and tension between them. It is perplexing to imagine why such a close bond between a mother and her children could be so troubled.</p><p>For starters, the custody battle and its effects on everyone's mental health certainly added strains to everyone's relationship with each other. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">While it's been confirmed that Finley and Harper are in deep mourning</a>, it's unconfirmed what the extent the trial had on the relationship with their mother.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Furthermore, the custody battle publicly proved that there have been disagreements between Lisa Marie and Michael Lockwood over parenting styles. This adds another layer of complexity to an already complicated situation. Trying to co-parent after a divorce can be extremely challenging, as many Americans are definitely aware.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/lisa-marie-presley-and-michael-lockwood-before-their-contentious-divorce.jpg><p>One factor that may have contributed to the relationship between Presley and her daughters was their age difference. As teenagers, Finley and Harper are at a stage in life where they are trying to assert their independence and establish their own identities. Their lives have been pretty private, which is a stark contrast to Lisa Marie's upbringing. This can be difficult for any family to navigate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Lisa Marie Presley's Daughters Will Inherit Graceland But What Will Happen To The Remainder Of Her Net Worth?</a></span></p><p>While there may be many factors contributing to the strained relationship between Lisa Marie and her twin daughters, it is important to remember that every family dynamic is unique. It is impossible for outsiders to fully understand what goes on behind closed doors.</p><h2 id=how-did-elvis-presley-impact-lisa-marie-presley-39-s-relationship-with-her-daughters>How Did Elvis Presley Impact Lisa Marie Presley's Relationship With Her Daughters?</h2><p>Elvis Presley, known as the "King of Rock and Roll", has left an indelible mark on music history. No, he wasn't just some character <a href=#>played by Lisa Marie's talented friend Austin Butler</a>. He completely changed the world and made the music industry what it is today. However, his impact extends beyond the world of music and into the realm of family dynamics.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Elvis Would've Made An Absolute Fortune Had He Been Allowed To Tour Overseas</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elvis's legacy has had a profound effect on Lisa Marie's family. Growing up with a famous father can be challenging for any child, but when that father is a cultural icon like Elvis, it can be particularly difficult to navigate relationships with one's kin. How someone is parented is certainly going to affect how that same person is going to parent their own children, to put it into simpler terms.</p><p>According to People, when Lisa Marie became a mother herself, she was determined to create a different kind of family dynamic for her own children - one that was more stable and present than the one she experienced growing up.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/elvis-presley-and-colonel-tom-parker.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The impact of Elvis's legacy on Lisa Marie's relationship with her daughters is complex</a>. On one hand, it has provided them with opportunities that they may not have had otherwise - such as attending concerts or meeting other celebrities. Lots of generational wealth as well. It has also created expectations for them to follow in their grandfather's footsteps - something that Lisa Marie is keenly aware of.</p><p>Lisa Marie has expressed concern about how much influence Elvis will have on her daughters' lives as they grow older. She worries that they will feel pressured to pursue careers in music or entertainment because it runs in their family rather than following their own passions.</p><p>Ultimately, Lisa Marie wants her daughters to be able to make their own choices and forge their own paths in life without feeling constrained by their family history. Beyond Elvis, <a href=#>Lisa Marie's late son is more proof of the family's tragic history</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, while there are many unknowns when it comes to Lisa Marie Presley's personal life and relationships with her family members, her life has undoubtedly left a legacy on both the public and her personal family. Things may not have been perfect, but Lisa Marie's potentially fatal battle for control of her kids proved she cared about her children. While her twin daughters live extremely private lives, it's safe to assume they understood their mother cared about them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijoquRYrqivsieZKmqlai5psXSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWnnsGpeceeqWasp567brDArp6hrJWnwG60wKunnqpdq7a3tcSnpZ5lkaO7bq3NnWSfoZ6hsrp5y6iapK%2BfpLFursSfpqudXam%2ForPInGSdnZGptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
