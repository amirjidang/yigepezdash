Let’s find out.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=huw-edwards-plastic-surgery-before-and-after></span>Huw Edwards Plastic Surgery: Before And After<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Several rumors about Huw Edwards’ plastic surgery have been circulating the web. But, the journalist has never opened up about undergoing any kind of surgery.&nbsp;</p><p>Edwards may have disguised himself to avoid public attention at some point. But he was never caught doing so, and such news has not even surfaced about him.&nbsp;</p><p>So, due to the lack of official information, it is safe to say that the journalist never underwent plastic surgery in his lifetime. Even if he did, the journalist does not want the public to know about it.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, rumors about his attempted suicide also surfaced in the media a few days back. But, the journalist has not made any suicide attempts even though he was a depressed patient for a long time.</p><p>Mr. Edwards acknowledged that his battle with depression started in 2002 when he was working as a newscaster.</p><p>He stressed that depression is a recurrent disease that comes and goes rather than an isolated incident.</p><p>He admitted that there were days when he couldn’t get out of bed, didn’t want to go to work, and had no desire to engage with others as he explained the overpowering severity of his despair.</p><p>Huw had to push himself to go on the broadcast and maintain a positive public image despite these difficulties. His severe sadness has occasionally made it impossible for him to work at all.</p><p><strong>More On Huw Edwards: </strong>Is Huw Edwards Leaving BBC After Scandal And Allegations?
