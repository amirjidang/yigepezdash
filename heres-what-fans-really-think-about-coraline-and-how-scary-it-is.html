That's right, the spooky<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;season is fast approaching</a>. The question fans are asking themselves right now is, can animated movies still be scary?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=not-just-for-kids>Not Just For Kids</h2><p>Coraline is a Halloween staple. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2009 claymation movie directed</a> by Henry Selick follows a young girl who finds a mysterious entrance to an alternate life that seems like her own, but better. Soon, however, a web of deception untangles and Coraline sees that not everything is as it seems. That's all you're getting without spoilers, but it's definitely worth a watch. Or two.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coralnie-and-cat.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The 15 Beest Horror Movies, Ranked From Least To Most Realistic</a></span></p><p>Fans took to Twitter to share their love <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">for the haunting flick, </a>most of them being adults. One fan shared, "I love the cute/creepy concept of Coraline so much. What other movies are like this? I think so far the most similar are monster house, corpse bride, and paranorman." Those are all classics, a chef's kiss to whoever wrote this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another Twitter user started a conversation on whether&nbsp;Coraline is just a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">movie or a piece of art</a>, "Unpopular opinion: Coraline is really not a scary movie. It's actually a work of art & deserves a second movie... Since it's trending, imma go watch it." While the storyline itself is enough of a reason to turn off the lights and dive into the movie, its animated effects are so entrancing that they're some spectators' favorite part.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coraline-and-cake.jpg><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Best (Non-Disney) Animated Films, Officially Ranked</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=creepy-comparison>Creepy Comparison</h2><p>A common thread shone throughout the tweets; comparing&nbsp;Coraline to other films within the animated horror genre. Well, horror as in movies that excited and terrified us when we were young. A fan voiced this same kind of viewpoint, "Coraline was creepy in a fun way but Monster House was one of the most disturbing movies I saw as a kid. I still get chills!!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coraline2.jpg><p>On the other hand, brave Coraline followers&nbsp;called out those who were scared of&nbsp;it&nbsp;at one point. A viewer posted a compilation video of scenes from the film and captioned it, "People who get nightmares from watching coraline are weak." Okay, tell us how you really feel! All in all, even those who remember being afraid of the Halloween classic share an overwhelming appreciation for its eccentric craftsmanship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Insane Fan Theories About The Time Burton Universe That Will Make You Say, "Whoa"</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZJ%2BZnqh6s7HApaOyZaSdtq%2B3jJqZqK2kYrCwvsCloKedXZa7pXnHqK5mq5OWv7p5yK1koqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
