It started on CBS in 2007, and would run for over a decade up until 2019. In truth, the show could've lasted longer than 12 seasons, but some of the cast, particularly Jim Parsons had decided it was time wrap up.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><ul><li><strong>Jim Parsons decided it was time for the show to end during the summer after season 11 came to an end.</strong></li></ul><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Kunal Nayyar Talks His Very First Roles Prior To 'The Big Bang Theory'</a></span></p><p>The decision wasn't an easy one to digest for the cast, especially for the likes of Kunal Nayyar. <a href=#>He spoke about his final day on the show</a> alongside People and as expected, getting through it was not easy.</p><p>"The last scene we were shooting, they added a joke, and I said it and I thought I would get another chance at it because we shoot most takes twice. But no, I got it and they said, ‘All right, moving on.’ And then that was the last words I was going to say as my character.”</p><p>“As I was walking up to my trailer, with every step the realization that those were the last words I would ever say as Raj began to really sink in,” he said. “I cried. I cried a lot.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>These days, thinking about his time on the sitcom, Nayyar would admit that it still isn't easy, especially when he talks to his co-stars.</p><h2 id=kunal-nayyar-revealed-that-the-conversations-usually-follow-a-certain-tone>Kunal Nayyar Revealed That The Conversations Usually Follow A Certain Tone</h2><p>Kunal Nayyar appeared on 'The Kelly Clarkson Show', alongside the replacement host for the day, Derek Hough.</p><p>It was during the interview that Kunal shared a surprising bit of information.
