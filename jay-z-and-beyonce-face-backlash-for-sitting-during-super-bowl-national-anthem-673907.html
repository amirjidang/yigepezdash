While a strong batch of other people were also sitting and enjoying Demi‚Äôs powerhouse vocals, eyes seemed to be locked in on the couple by a lot of clear folks on Twitter, including political pundit Tomi Lahren.</p><p>‚Äú<a href=# id=auto-tag_beyonce data-tag=beyonce>Beyonc√©</a> & Jay- Z (former crack dealer) sit for the national anthem because apparently the United States of America has oppressed them with millions upon millions of dollars & fans,‚Äù Lahren said. ‚ÄúSounds rough.

Jay‚Äôs deal with the NFL not only includes influence over the league‚Äôs music events (like the Super Bowl) but&nbsp; the&nbsp;‚ÄúInspire Change,‚Äù an initiative concerning ‚Äúeducation and economic advancement, police and community relations, and criminal justice reform.‚Äù The league will reportedly spend $100 million over the next 10 years to help with social justice outreach and other related programs.</p><p>When it comes to the negative press Jay-Z has faced, the businessman isn‚Äôt bothered.&nbsp;‚ÄúAs long as real people are being hurt and marginalized and losing family members, then yes, I can take a couple rounds of negative press,‚Äù he said. He also explained his prior comments about Kapernick. ‚ÄúNo one is saying he hasn‚Äôt been done wrong. He was done wrong. I would understand if it was three months ago. But it was three years ago and someone needs to say, ‚ÄòWhat do we do now ‚Äî because people are still dying?‚Äô‚Äù</p><p>You can read the full feature <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BuunnZZpinnF2Xsrq7zZycZp6RmLJursCcoqWZo516p7vRZqqirKSeu6h5w66poqaXYsC2vMSrZJunp6F6r63ToqanmZxirq%2FAx56kZm5naIZxg44%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
