If you can get fairly close to larger animals, a 70-200mm zoom can work.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-megapixels-do-i-need-for-bird-photography></span>How many megapixels do I need for bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The truth is that for most people (including professional photographers) any camera with <b>15-20 Megapixels or more</b> will be more than sufficient. CROP FACTOR – Both Canon and Nikon produce cameras that have full frame sensors as well as bodies that have sensors that are smaller than 35mm.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-mm-is-bird-photography></span>How many mm is bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>What is the best focal length for bird photography? While 300mm, 400mm, and even short zoom lenses can be useful at times for bird photography, my recommendation to those seriously interested in making quality photographs of birds is to purchase a lens with a focal length of <b>at least 500mm</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-much-zoom-do-i-need-for-bird-photography></span>How much zoom do I need for bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>For bird photography, you’ll want to have a lens that is capable of <b>at least 300mm zoom</b>. Woodland birds can be captured quite easily with zooms from 300-500mm.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-you-use-a-tripod-for-bird-photography></span>Should you use a tripod for bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Without a tripod or monopod, the effort of holding up the camera and lens (even a small lens) will start to strain your muscles, eventually causing muscular tremors that can result in blurred images when the bird does finally fly.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-you-need-a-tripod-for-bird-photography></span>Do you need a tripod for bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>A sturdy, lightweight tripod</b> is the most important tool for a bird/wildlife photographer. When shooting wildlife with long (and heavy) prime lenses such as the 600mm lens, a tripod is a must for providing stability and support.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-will-a-300mm-lens-zoom></span>How far will a 300mm lens zoom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The bottom line – on a crop frame camera a 70-300mm zoom (Canon, Nikon, Sony) will get you pretty good coverage from <b>15 yards to 56 yards away</b>, the ‘sweet spot’ for outdoor sports. If you’re shooting a full frame camera – the Canon 100-400mm gives similar coverage.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-many-times-zoom-is-300mm></span>How many times zoom is 300mm?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Here is an example: For a 300mm lens, divide 300 by 50 to get <b>6x magnification</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-300mm-zoom-equivalent-to></span>What is 300mm zoom equivalent to?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Originally Answered: How many times zoom is a 300mm lens? Let consider what our eye can see is equivalent to <b>17mm lens</b>. In compare to eye, 300mm lens will zoom 300/17 = 17.6 x. So we can say 300mm can zoom upto 17.6 times.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-300mm-lens-good-for></span>What is a 300mm lens good for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>So what are telephoto and superzoom lenses, like a 70-300mm, used for? They’re best when you want to get close to a distant subject. It could be a building on the horizon or a face in a crowd. They’re perfect for <b>wildlife photography</b>, where you can’t get close to the animals you want to shoot.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-a-300mm-lens-used-for></span>What is a 300mm lens used for?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>With a 300mm maximum focal length (450mm equivalent on DX-format cameras) it brings even the most distant action closer. It’s an ideal lens for <b>candids, travel and sports photography</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-can-75-300mm-lens-shoot></span>How far can 75-300mm lens shoot?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Specs<table><tbody><tr class=ztXv9><th style=padding-left:0>Focal Length</th><th>75 to 300mm</th></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Minimum Focus <b>Distance</b></td><td><b>4.92′ / 1.5 m</b></td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Maximum Magnification</td><td>0.25x</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Optical Design</td><td>13 Elements in 9 Groups</td></tr><tr><td style=padding-left:0>Diaphragm Blades</td><td>7</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=which-mode-is-best-for-bird-photography></span>Which mode is best for bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Shutter Priority</b> is the best mode to choose here. Set it anywhere from 1/15th to 1/100th. But you can also choose Bulb Mode to capture the whole range of motions of a bird. Here, when you are shooting with a long shutter speed, so you can lower the ISO.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-i-need-a-300mm-lens></span>Do I need a 300mm lens?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A 70-300 mm lens is a medium telephoto lens often employed for taking photos of wildlife, sporting events, and astronomical subjects such as the moon, planets, and stars. It is also recommended for <b>travel photography</b>, street photography, and other candid occasions.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-450mm-enough-for-bird-photography></span>Is 450mm enough for bird photography?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A lot of folks recommend <b>400mm as a minimum focal length for quality bird photography</b>. But even at this range, you’ll still need the bird to be quite close to you for your subject to fill the entire image frame.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-the-difference-between-300mm-and-400mm-lens></span>What is the difference between 300mm and 400mm lens?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The difference between 300mm and 400mm isn’t that great, but bear in mind that the 400mm prime will almost certainly be sharper than the 70-300. As somebody said in a another thread, the angle of view of the 400mm lens will be 300/400 = <b>3/4</b> of the angle of view of the 300mm.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-does-a-250mm-lens-zoom></span>How far does a 250mm lens zoom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>250 mm would be like <b>16–17 ft.</b> And focus range may vary depending on the lens..<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-can-a-200mm-lens-zoom></span>How far can a 200mm lens zoom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>A 200mm lens does not “zoom” at all</b>. A 70-200mm is about a 2.85 x zoom. What you are really asking is what is the “reach” of a lens. Taking 50mm as “normal” a 200mm would bring a subject 4 times closer, a 400mm 8 times.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-will-a-400mm-lens-reach></span>How far will a 400mm lens reach?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>On a full-frame camera, with a 400mm lens, you can reach <b>up to 8x zoom</b> and on a crop-sensor having 1.5 crop factor, you can get results of up to 600mm lens with the same 400mm lens. If you mean how far it can shoot, then you can shoot as far as you need. You can even reach the moon having melodramatic results.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-can-a-600mm-lens-see></span>How far can a 600mm lens see?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Are you asking the minimum focusing distance of that 600mm lens? If so the answer is <b>about 15ft</b>. If you mean how far away can it shoot distant objects then that depends on how big they are and how big you want them to be in the final image. It also depends on whether you are using a Full Frame or APS-C camera.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-far-can-a-dslr-zoom></span>How far can a DSLR zoom?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Zoom range is a big selling point for digital cameras and lenses. The average ‘kit’ lens sold with an entry-level DSLR or mirrorless camera will have a zoom range of <b>3x</b>, a premium kit lens might have a 5x zoom range, while a superzoom lens will have a zoom range of 10x or more.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46iqmZrYGW6rnnEp6aun5his7C%2BjJugq5xdpbWwwM6gqZqomK58</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
