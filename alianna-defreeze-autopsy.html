On Wednesday morning, the jurors were stunned after hearing the disturbing testimony and the pictures of the brutal injuries suffered by Alianna DeFreeze.</p><p>Alianna’s family confirmed that she was 14 years old at the time of her death. Christopher Whitaker was arrested and charged with the kidnapping, rape, and murder of 14-year-old Alianna in January 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>It was known that she went missing from Cleveland’s east side at the time she was on her way to school. The police reported they found her dead body three days later in a vacant house on Fuller Avenue.</p><p>Cuyahoga County Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. David Dolinak, who performed the autopsy of Alianna DeFreeze, said her wounds were caused by the tools found in the house. A screwdriver, a box cutter, and a drill caused some wounds on her body.&nbsp;</p><p>The DNA discovered from Alianna’s dead body matches Whitaker, as per Jeffrey Oblock, a DNA analyst with the Cuyahoga County Regional Forensics Laboratory.</p><p>Jeffrey also said, “<strong>In the absence of an identical twin, Christopher Whitaker is the source of the major DNA component in this mixture to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty</strong>.”</p><p>A statement was given to police by an assistant pastor at Gogatha Missionary Baptist Church on East 93rd Street, David Brewton, in which he said while he was unloading food pantry items from the truck, Whitaker helped him.&nbsp;</p><p>He added that it was the same day DeFreeze died. Whitaker was calm but was frustrated from working odd jobs, his behavior described by David.&nbsp;</p><p>David also said, “<strong>He appeared to me in his demeanor like the average guy I meet in that neighborhood on a daily basis</strong>.” The authorities say that David saw Whitaker once encountering Alianna on the same day she was brutally murdered.&nbsp;</p><p>Attorneys of Whitaker said their client was not found guilty of the charges but could be given the death penalty if convicted. His attorney added that they would be trying their best to spare him from death penalty charges.&nbsp;</p><p>The attorney planned to do something during the death penalty phase to lower his punishment sentence.</p><p>So, on the day of the death penalty phase, his attorney presented a psychological report which stated that Whitaker was high on cocaine and was not in his control when he murdered Alianna.</p><p>The report was written by Dr. Robert Kaplan, in which the doctor claims Whitaker is a drug addict and mostly consumes cocaine.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from cocaine, the doctor says Whitaker is addicted to alcohol and marijuana, which leads him to remember nothing from the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the prosecutors are working on bringing different evidence to prove that the psychological report from Whitaker’s attorney is false.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alianna DeFreeze autopsy</h2><p>After Alianna was discovered dead after being kidnapped for three days, her dead body was sent to the medical examiner’s office to find the cause of her death. Cuyahoga County Deputy Medical Examiner Dr. David Dolinak conducted her autopsy.&nbsp;</p><p>Several tests were performed on Alianna’s dead body to find the cause of her death. After all the tests were performed, her autopsy report was revealed, but no cause of death was mentioned.&nbsp;</p><p>David Dolinak said there were several injuries from the drill, screwdriver, and box cutter that he couldn’t testify to the cause of her death.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCty6KYp6aRYrGmstGenLOdXZbCtbvPrLBo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
