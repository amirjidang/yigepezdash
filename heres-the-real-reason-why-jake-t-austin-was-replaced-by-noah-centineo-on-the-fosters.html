Jake T. Austin or Noah Centineo? Who's a better actor for the character of Jesus on The Fosters? These are questions that popped to fans' minds when they saw that the former Wizards of Waverly Place star was recast. Of all the teen dramas, The Fosters is particularly emotional and quite the wild ride. It's hard not to cry when watching siblings Callie and Jude get adopted by a wonderful family who truly love them and want the best for them. Fans love Callie and Jude's new family, especially Jesus and Mariana, twins who had a hard time with their troubled birth mother, Anna.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are many <a href=#>cool behind-the-scenes facts about The Fosters</a>, including the fact that two different actors played Jesus. Sometimes actors get switched up before a show begins shooting its entire first season or after the pilot episode, and <a href=#>Bob Saget replaced an actor on Full House</a>. But in Jesus's case, this happened later on. Let's take a look at what happened.</p><h2 id=jesus-on-39-the-fosters-39>Jesus On 'The Fosters'</h2><p><a href=#>The Fosters talks about adoption</a> and Stef and Lena adopt Jesus and Mariana when they're very young. Jesus is a sweet and charming young boy who begins exploring his love of wrestling in season 1. He also falls in love with his classmate Emma. In the season 2 finale, Jesus is in a terrible car accident, and when the show came back for season 3, the actor had been replaced.</p><p>This is common on soap operas and it can be a little strange and jarring to see it on a teen drama, but both actors do an incredible job and showcase their talents on the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jake T. Austin played Jesus for seasons 1 and 2 of The Fosters, Noah Centineo played the character for the remaining seasons of the show.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jake T. Austin tweeted</a> that he wanted different roles and that's why he made the decision to say goodbye to The Fosters.</p><p>According to Hollywood Life, the actor responded to some fan questions and said, "I was only asked to return for 3 episodes and wasn’t going to be able to work on anything else, so I left…” When a fan said that they assumed he was interested in playing people older than teenagers, he said, "Not true. I just wanted to do roles with more substantive content.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Jake From State Farm Was Replaced</a></span></p><p>When Jake T. Austin knew that he was leaving, he tweeted "I’m honored to have been a part of such a groundbreaking series, but I personally want to let you know that my time on the show…. has come to an end. Thank you for letting me be a part of your family, it’s been a pleasure. -JTA," according to Variety.com.</p><p>Season 3 of The Fosters aired in June 2015, and while Noah Centineo is a household name now, the Netflix movies To All The Boys I've Loved Before hadn't yet been released, as the first movie came out on the streaming service in 2018. Now, it's fun to look back and see Noah playing the part of Jesus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When a fan started a thread on Reddit asking why two actors played this role, and a viewer shared that it seemed like they were preparing for the possibility that Jesus the character would leave the show. The fan wrote, "Jake T Austin found out that his character Jesus has a reduced role in season 3 so he didn’t want to miss out on opportunities. It was hinted of his departure by the mention of him going to some boarding school and by the end of the season he was involved in a car accident foreshadowing a possible death. But instead was recast."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Did Hollywood Replace Brendan Fraser With Tom Cruise?</a></span></p><h2 id=noah-joining-39-the-fosters-39>Noah Joining 'The Fosters'</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maia Mitchell really shines as Callie on The Fosters, and she told Just Jared Jr. that she was glad to have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Noah Centineo join the show as Jesus</a>.</p><p>The actress said, "It’s been good. We’re all very excited to have Noah. He’s awesome and super cool. I think we’re just ready for a fresh start and I’m really excited to be working with him. ”</p><p>It's interesting to note that while Jake T. Austin felt that Jesus didn't have much to do on the show, the character definitely is in a lot of episodes from seasons 3 to 5. Jesus and Mariana get to know Anna, which is really sweet to watch, and it's also heartbreaking watching Jesus recover from his car accident and do his best to get back to normal or some semblance of it. In season 4, Jesus discovers that his girlfriend Emma had an abortion and his brother Brandon supported her through it, and he's shocked and saddened that they would keep this from him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Rebecca Romijn Was Replaced As Mystique</a></span></p><p>Both Jake T.
