After The Rock ran down the Glendale, Arizona crowd and then took aim at Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins, he challenged both WWE stars to a tag match against The Rock and Roman Reigns. As he was closing the opening segment, The Tribal Chief surprised the live crwodn by demanding acknowledgment, creating a "holy sh--" moment for fans as The Rock hesitated before complying.</p><p>Despite a tag match set for WrestleMania 40's night one and potential singles matches on night two, reports suggest WWE still has a Rock versus Roman Reigns match in the cards. It won't happen at this year's show, but WWE is internally insistent that the highly anticipated singles match will eventually materialize. <a href=#>Wrestling Observer Newsletter</a> says “the idea from a company standpoint is that match will happen” at some point. WWE appears to have smartly rerouted plans due to potential fan backlash and is holding off the match, potentially taking a great deal of time to build it up when either Reigns or The Rock turns and one splits off from The Bloodline.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/the-rock-challenge.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Rock Challenges Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins To A Tag Match on Night 1 of WrestleMania</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Rock and Roman Reigns have challenged Cody Rhodes and Seth Rollins to a tag match at WrestleMania 40.</span><p>In short, WWE sees this match as way too big to just drop. They're finding another way to get there.</p><p>The Rock spent the first 30 minutes of SmackDown setting up this moment between him and Reigns. Not only that, but he posted a 21-minute promo on social media earlier in the day on Friday. He summed up a lot of how Cody, The Rock, and Roman all got to this point. Reigns was a willing participant in the tag match idea, but he wanted to ensure everyone still saw him as the Tribal Chief. He doesn't want anyone getting confused, thinking this is now The Rock's show to run.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wwe-will-eventually-determine-the-real-head-of-the-table>WWE Will Eventually Determine The Real Head of the Table</h2><p>With the title of Tribal Chief eventually at stake, WWE is likely to carefully plan the execution of this monumental clash. The plan is to get through WrestleMania 40, heavily feature The Rock and Roman on the same side, then allow anticipation to grow organically for what promises to be a blockbuster showdown in the wrestling world.</p><p>Who winds up being the babyface when it's all said and done isn't clear, but the expectation is that it won't be for the WWE Universal Championship (although that too may change.).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenrLJuvMuapaxlpJ2ybr7OnKJmqp%2Birq950Z6goKajYq6nwMSrZLCqlajBrbHMmqWimV1pfXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
