I’m doing makeup.’”</p><p>Jenner, 26, who noted that it’s “amazing” what makeup can do, assured Lawrence that it doesn’t look like she’s had any work done. (“Well, apparently I’ve had full plastic surgery,” Lawrence quipped.) The Kardashians star then claimed that she hasn’t had plastic surgery either — only lip fillers.</p><p>“I did end up getting lip fillers, but it’s also the same with me,” Jenner revealed. “I’ll see before and after photos when I’m 12 years old versus 26 and my eyebrows are filled differently. I have contour on. I’m like, ‘How can you compare my 12-year-old face and say I’ve gotten my jaw shaved and eyelids removed?’ I’m like, ‘What are we talking about?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-WSJ-Innovator-Awards-Kylie-Jenner-Feature.jpg><p>Lawrence, who’s a <a href=#>longtime friend</a> of the Kardashian family, agreed with Jenner that it boils down to the aging process.</p><p>“I started at 19, so I get the before and after pictures from when I’m 19 to 30, and I’m like, ‘I grew up, I lost baby weight in my face, and my face changed because I’m aging.’ Everybody thought I had a nose job, and I’m like, ‘I’ve had the exact same nose. My cheeks got smaller. Thank you for bringing it up,’” Lawrence said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Jennifer-Lawrence-Responds-to-Speculation-She-Had-Plastic-Surgery-What-Are-We-Talking-About-505.jpg><p>Aside from debunking plastic surgery rumors, the duo discussed wide ranging topics such as their careers and motherhood. Jenner opened up about <a href=#>starting her makeup line</a>, Kylie Cosmetics, “from the ground up.”</p><p>“It was me and my mom and we never made a makeup line. We didn’t know where to start. We didn’t have anyone helping us. And my mom thought I was going to be stuck with lip kits in my garage for the rest of my life,” Jenner recalled. “I think we ordered 5,000 of each color; that was the minimum. And she was like, ‘You better be ready, Kylie, because you might have a lot of lip kits in your garage for the rest of your life, so you better love these colors.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Jenner’s cosmetic company has generated <a href=#>at least $900 million</a> since it began in November 2015. The website even crashed within one minute of its initial launch.</p><p>“And then it broke in two seconds, and that’s when we were like, ‘OK, how do we do this? How do we make these faster and better?’” Jenner said. “We got in my mom’s car and drove all over California and visited all these factories. Finding the best manufacturer was difficult. We were a new company, so growing in front of a lot of people was hard. You don’t have room to make mistakes. But it wasn’t a bad thing. It was so successful and it was the best time of my life.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGajnZ6jtqex0Wajmq%2BimruksYydnKehlah6qa3VoqWgZZWusm6%2F1KuenqqpYrSmwNOipaBlkWK7sL%2FEZqGoml8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
