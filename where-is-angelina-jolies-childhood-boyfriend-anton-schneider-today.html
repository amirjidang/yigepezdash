As the Tomb Raider, Maleficent and Mr. & Mrs. Smith star continues to navigate the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tricky waters of divorce with her last husband</a>, we revisit her first flame and find out what he has been up to.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Angelina Jolie's Divorce From Brad Pitt Hurt Her Acting Career</a></span></p><h2 id=quickly-hit-it-off>Quickly Hit It Off</h2><p>Jolie's first serious, adult relationship was with English actor Jonny Lee Miller, today known for portraying the classic character of detective Sherlock Holmes in the CBS drama, Elementary. They got married in 1996.</p><p>Although the exact timeline is not very clear, Jolie was also for a time involved with the model, Jenny Shimizu. "I probably would have married Jenny Shimizu if I hadn't married my husband (Miller)," Jolie told Girlfriends magazine in 1997. "I fell in love with her the first second I saw her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jolie and Miller divorced in 1999, as she ventured into another relationship. Her short courtship and later, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">marriage to Billy Bob Thornton</a> were well-publicized; the lovebirds often made a very public show of their affection for one another. That particular union lasted three years, paving the way for Jolie's most famous relationship - with fellow superstar Brad Pitt.</p><p>The fairytale 'Brangelina' love story - as the couple were fondly christened by their fans - lasted a lot longer. They were together for a total of 12 years, five of which were spent married. They also had six children together, three of whom were adopted from different countries around the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About Angelina Jolie And Jonny Lee Miller's Marriage</a></span></p><h2 id=met-while-they-were-teenagers>Met While They Were Teenagers</h2><p>All of these relationships happened following Jolie's rise to fame and wealth. But before anyone outside of her family really knew her name, she had a childhood lover who introduced her to the fickle world of romance. Jolie and Anton Schneider met while they were teenagers. In 2016, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she spoke to The Sun</a> about how her mother allowed Schneider to live with them for a while.</p><p>"One of my boyfriends lived with me at my mum’s house when I was just 14," the actress recalled. "It was the smartest thing my mother could have done because, this way, we weren’t hanging out in a park together. We lived like a married couple for two years. By the time I was 16, I wanted my freedom and wanted to focus on work. So I graduated from high school early and went to work. I did not date until I met Jonny."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Jolie grew up to become the global icon we know today, Schneider didn't do too badly for himself either. He became a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">successful costume designer in Hollywood</a>, where he has lent his expertise to projects like MADtv, Mad Men and Mike & Molly.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Close Are Angelina Jolie And Johnny Depp Today?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqqv4yapaCdnJ67onnJqKOinaNisKm1y52fqKeUYq%2BwxcWroJ6mlGKur8DOp2Ssm5ijsqqwxKtkraeUlsZw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
