Take that make up off then it’s tickets. I have receipts.”</p><p>Some fans on Twitter insisted that it was pure coincidence that the “Can’t Nobody” hitmaker would sport the same ensemble as the radio personality with a matching scenery while others deemed this as subtle diss from the mother of two.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Rowland hasn’t addressed the matter at hand, but from the way it seems, it doesn’t look as if she was trying to be all that elusive about her shady photo given the similarities between her pic and the one from Mdoda.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Celebs Congratulate Destiny's Child's Kelly Rowland As She Announces Baby No. 2</a></span></p><p>In February, Rowland, <a href=#>who is worth a whopping $12 million</a>, dropped her latest EP, K, which included six tracks as a sneak peek offering to what’s to come as the mother of two plans to commence work on her next studio album.</p><p>Speaking on putting together her latest project, she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Houston Chronicles</a>, “I just wanted the record to feel good.

I really wanted to move, and I think because of the year we had with 2020, I think we all deserve to dance. We had to dance our way out of that, just because it was so freaking rough.</p><p>Earlier this year, it was also rumored that Rowland would be reuniting with her band members Beyoncé and Michelle Williams for a Destiny’s Child comeback after social media images for the group were updated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The “Stole” songstress hasn’t addressed those claims, so it’s either happening and she can’t talk about it or there’s something in the works and updating Destiny’s Child’s social media photos was just a sneak peek tease.</p><p>Beyoncé has also revealed that she’s working on new music, but is it for a solo project or for a potential album with DC?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Did Kelly Rowland Almost Go Broke By Trying To Keep Up With Beyonce’s Lifestyle?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqScrnqzu9almKecXaeypL7Emqueq12ltbDAzmamn2WilrGqu4yhpqysXay1sHnCmqOlnZRitaa%2BjK6epbFdlrulecWapaxlk5a7tXnSraapZZyWwqi0yKeeaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
