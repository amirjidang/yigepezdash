There's also the fact that he flashes more cash than most people with his net worth.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Jake Paul Celebrates After Floyd Mayweather Fight With ‘Gotcha Hat’ Tattoo</a></span></p><p>But other things have been going on, too, like <a href=#>assault allegations brought by a TikTok star</a>. Though the alleged event happened years ago, plenty of new information is coming up about Paul.</p><p>So at this point, fans are sort of relieved to have something else to worry about with Jake Paul: his hairline. But what's up with Paul's hair, and why are fans worried about it?</p><h2 id=what-does-jake-paul-do-to-his-hair>What Does Jake Paul Do To His Hair?</h2><p>Fans are used to seeing Jake Paul's hair a certain way. So when they first noticed his apparently receding hairline, they wondered if maybe his style had changed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For a long time, Jake kept his hair longer on top with a fade; on the sides and back of his scalp, he was nearly bald. But on the top, he had a mop of blonde hair that he often styled straight up.</p><p>Sure, sometimes Jake lets the sides of his hair grow out, but that wave up top is sort of his trademark. Even as he's adopted a 'rougher' look for his boxing matches recently -- showing off his tattoos, including one on his scalp -- that blonde top remained.</p><p>Though Jake hasn't changed his hairstyle drastically in recent days, that doesn't mean his hairline hasn't been doing its own thing. The thing is, when Jake sweeps his hair back, fans see something that concerns them.</p><h2 id=jake-paul-39-s-hairline-might-be-receding>Jake Paul's Hairline Might Be Receding</h2><p>In what soon became a very popular online conversation, one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor</a> shared a snapshot of Jake Paul running his hand through his hair. Only, in the somewhat grainy photograph, he has a clear widow's peak.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though his wavy/curly hair usually covers up his scalp, the image of Jake pulling his hair back shows that he may be balding in the front area of his hairline. Critics had plenty of jokes about his hair (including one who said he looked like Pac-Man).</p><p>But most people are assuming the photo is real and accurate enough that it shows what Paul's hair really looks like. Other photos reinforce the idea that Jake's hairline is receding prematurely, even though his trademark style is excellent camouflage in most of his social media snapshots.</p><h2 id=how-old-is-jake-paul>How Old Is Jake Paul?</h2><p>Some fans start searching for Jake Paul's age to figure out why his hairline might be receding. The thing is, Paul is only 24. But as commenters noted on the Reddit thread discussing Paul's potential hairline problem, people (men and women) of any age can experience hair loss or their hairline receding.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's no fun to have to deal with, if Jake's hair really is having some thinning and balding, it's unfortunately pretty common. Some seeming non-fans even agreed it was fine to joke about hair loss because they'd been there, too.</p><p>Then again, Jake's attitude (and notoriety) might be the reason for some commenters' jokes about his hair. Especially since a lot of his opponents in the ring have more hair than Paul seems to.</p><h2 id=what-is-jake-doing-about-his-hair>What Is Jake Doing About His Hair?</h2><p>The next question people have about Jake's hair is what he plans to do about it. So far, the answer seems to be nothing. He's been busy with boxing, and of course, <a href=#>building a $17M net worth</a> is pretty labor-intensive and time-consuming.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's not like Paul really has time to worry about his hair while he's in the boxing ring or hitting the gym. But as some commenters note, he could definitely afford some kind of hair treatment if he wanted.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Turn On Jemele Hill After She Asks 'Inappropriate' Question To Jake Paul</a></span></p><p>The thing is, now that fans have seen Jake Paul's hairline as it is currently, they'd likely notice if he underwent some type of hair implant procedure. Not that he cares about the public's opinion, of course!</p><p>Really, fans are hoping Jake does (or doesn't do) whatever he feels he needs to, for himself and not anyone else. But for the time being, it seems like he's not doing anything other than his really creative combover.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Maybe his hairline has been a source of embarrassment for a while already, and that explains Paul's longtime shaggy-topped style?</p><p>That's one way of addressing a potential hairline problem, and at least Jake has plenty of hair elsewhere on his scalp to cover up the bare spots.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>10 Little-Known Facts About Jake Paul's Ex-Girlfriends</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidmqajYq6zsYycpqeblae7prCMmpmoraRit6K3xGanmq2cqHqprciro6KmlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
