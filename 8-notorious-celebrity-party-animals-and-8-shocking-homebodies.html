Most assume that the lifestyle of a celeb is glamorous and easy. With all the fame and fortune, many famous actors, musicians, and reality stars can pretty much do whatever they want. It’s not as easy as some may assume but it’s still pretty awesome. Celebs appear on the covers of magazines, break all kinds of records, and are admired by their fans. Oftentimes, celebs will take advantage of their high status and popularity. Some love the life so much that they party as hard as possible. Some celebrities have become synonymous with the hard partying lifestyle. Not all celebs like to party until they pass out, though, and in many cases they don’t enjoy partying at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For some celebs, a wild evening includes a quiet night in with a good book. They don’t enjoy staying up all night and getting drunk out of their minds. On the other hand, some find the idea of staying home and reading ridiculous. It’s really no surprise to hear that some of the most famous celebs party like a wild ‘70s rock star. However, it is a bit shocking to know that some of the most beautiful and famous celebrities just want to stay home. Here is a look at 8 Notorious Celebrity Party Animals and 8 Shocking Homebodies.</p><h2 id=katy-perry-party-animal><strong>Katy Perry (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katy Perry</a> loves to attend the wildest and most epic parties. However, as much as she loves to attend a party, she loves throwing parties even more. To some, Katy is best known for releasing numerous hit singles, such as “I Kissed A Girl,” “Firework,” and “Wide Awake.” To others, she’s best known as the wildest party animal. Katy has attended several parties and club events where she is the life of the party. She is often seen at Coachella and other major parties stealing the spotlight. She never misses an after party and attends just about every awards show pre and post parties. However, she is also a very skilled party thrower. For her 24th birthday, she had a “fantasy birthday party” where she dressed as Queen’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freddie Mercury</a>. She’s also done an Alice in Wonderland theme and one year rented out an entire skating rink then hired McDonald’s to cater it. She truly is the Mad Hatter of party animals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bradley-cooper-homebody><strong>Bradley Cooper (Homebody)</strong></h2><p>Some believe that the legend of the party animal,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bradley Cooper</a>, is a myth. However, Cooper was once a crazy partier but has retired from the life. Cooper once loved to party hard and had substance addiction. He was struggling in his career but eventually gave up the party and got clean. He’s now a very proud homebody. Luckily for us, Cooper went on to have a great career. He received widespread praise for his roles in The Hangover, Silver Linings Playbook, and American Hustle. Prior to his fame, Cooper was the definition of a party animal. Once, while at a club, he bashed his head on the floor to prove how tough he was. However, he now prefers to be a homebody and stay in. He said, “If I continued it, I was really going to sabotage my whole life. I don’t drink or do drugs anymore.” Instead, Cooper now stays home and avoids the party animal lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=justin-bieber-party-animal><strong>Justin Bieber (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber</a> has been to Los Angeles, Miami, Toronto, London, Paris, and more. Those aren’t places he’s only performed but also some of the places he’s partied hard. His intense and epic partying lifestyle is his true claim to fame. Justin has released several chart topping albums, including&nbsp;My World 2.0, Under the Mistletoe, Believe, and Purpose. He often finds himself in the headlines for several controversies and his hard partying style. He’s attended numerous wild parties that only get more out-of-control when Justin arrives. He’s been spotted at nightclubs, on yachts, and hotels at the center of an epic party. His parties are known for having various drugs, cannabis, and alcohol. He once threw an insanely wild house party that had neighbors complaining. Additionally, women usually surround him at these events. However, in the last several months, he’s calmed down his partying just a little.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shia-labeouf-homebody><strong>Shia LaBeouf (Homebody)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Shia LaBeouf</a> is constantly making headlines with his wild and erratic behavior. He’s had several run-ins with the law and many personal problems. He prefers being a homebody and doesn’t enjoy going to wild parties. Shia first gained attention for his role in the Disney series&nbsp;<i>Even Stevens</i>. Later, he had his big breakthrough role in <i>Transformers</i>. He’s appeared in numerous movies, such as<i>&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,</i> and <i>Nymphomaniac.</i> Shia has created a lot of controversy for his intense and sometimes erratic behavior. He claims that he prefers staying home and doesn’t like going to clubs. However, he still likes to party and is the only homebody party animal. He said,&nbsp;“I don’t like going to clubs. If I’m going to party, I’ll do it at my house.” So all he did was find a way to combine the club life and staying home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lindsay-lohan-party-animal><strong>Lindsay Lohan (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a>’s wild partying lifestyle is legendary in Hollywood. She is best known for her roles in the films The Parent Trap and Mean Girls. However, her intense partying is what she’s truly known for. She was seen at just about every club and party possible, tearing up the dance floor. She often went on partying benders such as the time she partied for 48 hours straight. She started Friday night at a Beverly Hills Club, then partied hard at the Chateau Marmont, then to a house party, and ended up back at the Chateau. In 2008, she was in a relationship with DJ <a href=#>Samantha Ronson</a> and often accompanied her to events as well as promoted them. Her lifestyle became a little too intense and resulted in several rehab stints. She calmed down her partying but was seen from time to time at a club or event. However, she is now much more focused on her humanitarian work and seems to have put the partying behind her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence-homebody><strong>Jennifer Lawrence (Homebody)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Lawrence</a> is a party animal at heart but her insane schedule forces her to be a homebody. Lawrence had her big breakthrough with her roles as Katniss Everdeen in the <i>Hunger Games</i> franchise and Mystique in the <i>X-Men</i> franchise. Additionally, she won an Academy Award for her role in <i>Silver Linings Playbook</i>. Obviously, she’s got a full plate but has attempted to make time for some partying. She’s been spotted partying it up with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amy Schumer</a>; but for the most part, she stays at home. She said, “I’ve kind of been a big homebody lately.” However, she does hope that one day, she’ll have more time to party like a rockstar. She also said, “But I think eventually, one of these days, I guess when the next franchise starts and I’m not in it, and the new Jennifer Lawrence is born, then I’ll be able to go outside.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-party-animal><strong>Drake (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p>It’s a little known fact that the Canadian word for party animal is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Drake</a>. Drake can do it all; he can sing, dance, act, and party like a rock god. Drake has broken Billboard records and sold out stadiums all over the world. However, his intense partying lifestyle often has everyone talking. In 2016, he threw an epic birthday event attended by just about every celebrity, including Katy Perry, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jamie Foxx</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">French Montana</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift</a>. He often parties all night long and shuts the club down. In fact, there was one time when he really shut down a club in Oklahoma City because of a wild party that saw him puffing away on his “medication.” Drake even has his very own exclusive party spot in Toronto, Sher Club. It’s located on the second level of the Air Canada Centre. Drake can often be found in the club tearing up the dance floor and partying into the early morning.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-homebody><strong>Selena Gomez (Homebody)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Selena Gomez</a> is quickly becoming one of the most in-demand celebs. One might assume that because of her popularity, Selena spends her nights partying like the rock star that she is. However, despite constantly being in the headlines and center of attention, Selena would rather just stay in and out of the spotlight. She first became a Disney star with her role in <i>Wizards of Waverly Place.</i> Later, she starred in several films, including&nbsp;<i>Ramona and Beezus, Spring Breakers,&nbsp;</i>and <i>Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising</i>. She struggled with her personal life and had several medical issues. However, she didn’t turn to the partying lifestyle to deal with these problems. Instead, she likes staying at home and is happy as a homebody. She doesn’t enjoy going to a wild party or spending the night at a club. She said, “I like to sleep. I like to relax. I like to be at home and not go out.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-kardashians-party-animals><strong>The Kardashians (Party Animals)</strong></h2><p>The Kardashian-Jenner family has taken partying to a whole new level. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kim</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Khloe</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kourtney Kardashian</a>, as well as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kris</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kendall</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner</a>, are known for enjoying the wild partying lifestyle. Often, the mother and daughters have been spotted at the most famous clubs, dancing ‘til their feet are sore. Out of all of them, Khloe seems to be the wildest party animal, which is really saying something. The Kardashians became world famous after receiving their own reality series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians,&nbsp;and the many spin-offs. The Kardashians have thrown epic birthday parties, extravagant wedding parties, and lavishly insane parties just for fun. In fact, not too long ago, Khloe celebrated her birthday in grand fashion with the ultimate b-day party to end all parties. It was a surprise thrown by her family and included a wild night of dancing, drinking, and of course, a photo booth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=taylor-swift-homebody><strong>Taylor Swift (Homebody)</strong></h2><p>Grammy Award winner <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> has been spotted with her elite Swift Squad tearing up the town. However, they don’t exclusively party at the club. Sometimes, they stay a little closer to home to get their dance on. Taylor has set Guinness World Records and has been voted one of Time’s Most Influential people on several occasions. She’s released several immensely popular albums, including&nbsp;<i>Fearless,</i><i>Speak Now,</i> and <i>1989.</i> She loves to spend time with her friends but they don’t have to get all dolled up and party hard. Swift prefers to stay at home but still finds ways to have fun. Taylor likes being a homebody and enjoys doing simple things with her friends. Taylor said, “I’ve loved really being with my girlfriends a lot. Like, there have been a lot of kitchen dance parties with my girlfriends.” She doesn’t care to tear up the dance floor at a club because she’s clearly too busy tearing up her kitchen floor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rihanna-party-animal><strong>Rihanna (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p>It’s almost guaranteed that if there is an epic party,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna</a> will be there. Not only is she the life of the party, but she is the party, and it doesn’t start until she gets there. She has released several record-breaking singles, including “SOS,” “Work,” “We Found Love,” “Stay,” and “Umbrella.” Besides selling out stadiums and releasing groundbreaking albums, there are two things Rihanna loves to do—smoke cannabis and party like it’s 1999. Rihanna has been spotted at several events, clubs, and epic parties. She’s gone on several partying benders and shuts down every club she attends. She’s been seen twerking all night long and going from club to club showing off her skills. She was even spotted at the ultimate party, Coachella, on her bodyguard’s shoulders as she prepared her “medication” in the middle of the jam-packed event. It’s safe to say that Rihanna is the quintessential party animal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-lively-homebody><strong>Blake Lively (Homebody)</strong></h2><p>One would assume that someone as popular and beautiful as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake Lively</a> would be at the club every night having guys buying her drinks. Well, it’s never a good idea to make assumptions. Despite being in great demand, Blake likes to stay home rather than hit up a club or party. Now that she’s married with children, it’s even less likely. Blake is best known for her roles in Gossip Girl and The Sisterhood of the Travelling Pants. Blake prefers to stay at home and even said, “I’m much more of a homebody than a person who goes out. I don’t think I’ve ever been to a club other than to see a band or if the Gossip Girl producers are throwing an after-party specifically for us to go to, or the red carpet.” Other than those mandatory parties, she enjoys staying home. She also said, “But I have never gone out, just to go out, because I don’t really find it that fun.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paris-hilton-party-animal><strong>Paris Hilton (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paris Hilton</a> is the Queen of the party animals. Paris has appeared in reality shows, movies, and music videos but her true talent is going to the club and shutting it down. There is no socialite that is as synonymous with partying as much as Paris. She first rose to fame after appearing in a private video that was leaked days before the premiere of the reality series,&nbsp;<i>The Simple Life</i>. Soon, she became the “it” girl and began attending every party in the world. She was often photographed dancing the night away and partying like a rock star. In fact, she was often paid to show up at a club and be the life of the party. Paris has attempted many different careers and business ventures. The one that she is best suited for is her new career as a DJ. She gets to be at awesome parties, tour the world, play great music, and be the center of attention.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mila-kunis-homebody><strong>Mila Kunis (Homebody)</strong></h2><p>For some celebs, partying means going to a club with loud music and beautiful people wearing very little clothes. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mila Kunis</a> has a different idea of what partying means to her. Mila Kunis had her first big break on the hit comedy <i>That '70s Show</i>. She’s also appeared in the films <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</i> and <i>Black Swan.</i> Additionally, she provides the voice of Meg on the animated sitcom <i>Family Guy.</i> Shockingly, Mila is a homebody despite likely getting several party invitations. She’s currently married to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ashton Kutcher</a>, and they have two&nbsp;children together. However, she was a homebody long before she got married. She is her own kind of party animal. She said, “I don’t go out very often. I prefer to stay home and have a nice little beverage and watch television. My glass of wine and I are besties.” Mila would rather stay at home curled up on her couch rather than attend an insane party on a yacht.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio-party-animal><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio (Party Animal)</strong></h2><p>The King of the party animals is the one and only <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. It appears that the older he gets, the more partying he plans on doing. Leo has won an Academy Award and has starred in the most classic critically-acclaimed films. However, most men are jealous of the fact that he parties pretty much every day of his life with the hottest models in the world. In fact, before he became world famous, he was a member of an infamous posse, which the full name cannot be printed here. Leo and his crew of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Toby Maguire</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">David Blaine</a>, <a href=#>Harmony Korine</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lukas Haas</a> went from club to club searching out women. Now, he throws epic parties at clubs and on yachts. Leo has not slowed down his partying whatsoever. In fact, he can often be seen at clubs surrounded by a plethora of women partying as hard as possible.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=megan-fox-homebody><strong>Megan Fox (Homebody)</strong></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Megan Fox</a> has often found herself at the center of controversy and in the headlines. However, it was never because she was a wild party animal because she’s actually a devoted homebody. Fox had her big breakthrough role in <i>Transformers</i>. She’s widely regarded as the most beautiful celebrity of the 21st century. She often tops most beautiful and hottest lists. Fox likely gets a plethora of invitations to hit up the club or party all night. She chooses not to party and likes to stay home. She believes that because of her controversial image that most people assume she’s an intense party animal. “I’ve always been maternal. I’m a homebody — I’m not wild … I think maybe I give off this energy of seeming like I don’t give a (expletive), and that’s misinterpreted. But I’m not wild.” Megan would rather stay at home with her family than spend the night at a party.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">perezhilton</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">hollyfame</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">huffingtonpost</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZxZZ6kwbC%2ByKisrGWTmrmmrtGiq7JloJa%2FtcWMmqWipZGhwG6tzZ1kcWWjnbykt8innmagn6Kyo7vDopysZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
