Many Hollywood dads have given glimpses into their lives with their little ones, from <a href=#><strong>Thomas Rhett</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Travis Scott</strong></a>.</p><p>The country singer shares daughters Willa, Ada and Lennon with his wife, <strong>Lauren Akins</strong>. The Grammy nominee was “born to be a girl dad,” he <a href=#>exclusively told Us Weekly in October 2019</a>.</p><p>“I love it,” the Georgia native gushed at the time. “I love doing their hair, and I love playing the Barbies with them, whatever they want me to do, tea parties. It’s just been awesome to get to be a dad of two beautiful girls and a third one on the way.”</p><p>Akins noted that her husband was “learning” to style their daughters’ hair. “He’s doing it actually pretty well,” the Live in Love author told Us. “I’m impressed.”</p><p>The couple added that when they found out the sex of baby No. 3, they were shocked to learn that they didn’t have a boy on the way.</p><p>“Ninety percent of our family thought it was a boy,” the “Marry Me” singer explained to Us. “I thought for sure it was a boy. When I saw the pink smoke come out of that thing, I was just like, ‘Oh, my gosh.’”</p><p>As for Scott, the rapper <a href=#>welcomed</a> daughter <a href=#>Stormi</a> with on-again, off-again girlfriend <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> in April 2018. The Texas native “is a very hands-on dad and engaged,” a source exclusively told Us the following year. “<a href=#>He spoils his daughter</a> rotten and absolutely loves her to death and would do anything to make her life the best that it can be.”</p><p>In December 2019, the Cactus Jack creator <a href=#>told XXL Magazine</a> that fatherhood was “better than what [he] thought it would be.”</p><p>Scott explained, “Stormi is one of the best human beings I know. She’s like my best friend. She makes life a little bit easier. She just inspires me and she surprises me every day with how she’s thinking. It’s so crazy.”</p><p>The “Sicko Mode” rapper called the toddler a “battery” that same year, explaining to GQ Germany that <a href=#>Stormi gives him “tremendous energy.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He gushed in October 2019: “[She] showed me so many things that I did not [get before]. Many things in life I only noticed when my daughter was born. [Fatherhood] is the most impressive thing that ever happened to me. Really.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see more celebrity dads spending time with their children over the years, from <a href=#><strong>Dwayne Johnson</strong> </a>to <a href=#><strong>Dwyane Wade</strong></a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNkwKbE2GaanqSVl3qlrcOsZGtoYWeCens%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
