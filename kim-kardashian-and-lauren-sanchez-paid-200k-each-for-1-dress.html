The stunning piece was valued at around $98,668 to $148,002. According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, Kardashian attained the pendant for $200,000.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The gorgeous jewel, which features a Fleurée cross set with square-cut amethysts and circular-cut diamonds, was created in the 1920s by court jeweler Garrard. The sparkler was purchased by Naim Attallah and lent to Diana in 1987. The Princess of Wales wore the gem to an event in support of Birthright, a charity that strives to protect human rights during pregnancy and childbirth. She paired the piece with an eye-catching black and purple Catherine Walker & Co. gown. The look is perhaps one of Diana’s most talked about ensembles to date.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1><span class=s1>According to Sotheby’s, the necklace was one of Diana’s “favorite” pieces. “Through Attallah’s friendship with Princess Diana, he loaned it to her several times over a number years,” Sotheby’s wrote via Instagram on January 14. “It is understood that the cross was only ever worn by the Princess and following her death, it was never seen in public again until now.” (Diana <a href=#>died at age 36 in a car crash</a> in Paris in 1997.)&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>The luxury marketplace added: “The pendant is a highlight of the Royal & Noble sale, which is open for bidding online until 18 January. The exhibition is open to the public at our New Bond Street galleries in London until 18 January.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6C2rnnKmqmdmaOdtqK6jJqlnWWclsKzsc1mqpqmk52yu3nPmqCdZWJlfax5xJqaoWWWpL9ufYydqZ6ro2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
