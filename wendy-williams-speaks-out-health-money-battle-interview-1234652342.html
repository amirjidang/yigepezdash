Williams also said her doctors said she has the “mind and body of a 25-year-old.”</p><p>While she couldn’t appear on camera for unknown reasons, Holmes said the daytime talk show host is back home in New York City after reportedly spending several months in Florida to be with her father and family.</p><p>Williams also used the interview to blast Wells Fargo bank. It was revealed back in February that the bank reportedly froze Williams bank accounts, stating that the queen of all media is of “unsound mind,” and believes “she is the victim of undue influence and financial exploitation,” resulting in her inability to pay her bills and staff.</p><p>“They say that I need somebody to handle my account. And I don’t want that,” Williams said about the bank’s conservatorship request. “I want all my money. I want to see all my money that I’ve worked hard for my entire life. My entire life. I don’t lie, I don’t cheat and I don’t steal. I am an honest, hard-working person.”</p><p>When Holmes asked why she thinks the bank believes she’s not of sound mind, Williams said, “I want to spend more time with my family. And you know, working out and waiting for the responses to my money situation and Wells Fargo. And they don’t like that. I’ve worked hard every single day, even on days when you know, I might have a little cold.</p><p>“If I was sick because you know, my back — or you know, when I got the lymphedema and stuff like that — I would still do my show. But quickly, not long time, very quickly, it went bad regarding this money thing.”</p><p>In a statement to <a href=# rel=nofollow>PEOPLE</a> back in February, Wells Fargo denied any allegations of improper actions towards Wendy Williams’ accounts.</p><p>Before ending the interview, Williams had a message to all of her fans. “This is what I would love to say to my Wendy watchers: Keep watching because I’m going to be back on the Wendy show bigger and brighter than ever.”</p><p>Hear Williams’ and Holmes’ chat below, courtesy of Good Morning America.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6yyr7DYZq6ipJyerq6%2FjKynnpmbqHqwwdNmn56ZnKm1brnOp5yyZZKWwbW4xGagp6yVp8OqsdZmaGtrZGuCc3%2BTa2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
