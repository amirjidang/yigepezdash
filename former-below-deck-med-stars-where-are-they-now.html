The Australia native <a href=#>appeared in five seasons of the hit reality series before her feud</a> with <a href=#><strong>Captain Sandy Yawn</strong></a> reached a boiling point.</p><p>After bosun <a href=#><strong>Malia White</strong></a> reported her roommate <a href=#>for having Valium and a CBD vape pen in her cabin</a>, Sandy fired Hannah.

Like she says, like, ‘Oh, it wasn’t personal,’ like,​​ the firing. I was like, ‘It’s kind of funny because<strong> Kat [Held]</strong> had prescription meds that <strong>Captain Lee</strong> had found out about and she didn’t get fired,'” Hannah exclusively told Us Weekly in May 2021 about where the duo stands now. “There wasn’t a need to fire me for that. It was a hundred percent personal, but I guess whatever helps you sleep at night.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sandy, for her part, <a href=#>didn’t rule out a possible reconciliation in the future</a>. “Hannah doesn’t want any part of me [but] I’m happy for her in everything that she’s doing. Honestly I’ve never had a feeling of hate. It doesn’t live in my heart,” the Florida native explained to Us in July 2022. “If Hannah ever opened the door, of course [I would get back in touch. There was a relationship there. I’m sorry that there’s not, but I mean, what can I do? I living my life. She’s living hers.”</p><p>Scroll down to learn more about how some former Below Deck Med stars have kept busy after the show:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BbvLO5xKtkm52cpMRusMScomallZl6tMDAq6pmr5iav6Z5wKucZqyYmsZuus6wZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
