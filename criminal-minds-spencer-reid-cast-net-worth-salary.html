He's a Ph.D. in physics and mathematics and nobody knows what the third one is and I'm in no way scientifically minded. I think he's way more analytical than I am."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Landing the role of Spencer Reid changed everything for Matthew Gray Gubler, and because of the show's longstanding success, the actor was able to make a fortune while playing one of the show's most popular characters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Shows Like 'Criminal Minds' To Watch If You Miss The Iconic Crime Drama</a></span></p><h2 id=the-show-paid-him-well>The Show Paid Him Well</h2><p>So, how much did Matthew Gray Gubler make from playing Spencer Reid on Criminal Minds?

Back in 2012, for instance, it was announced that Gubler was getting a bump in pay to start making $100,000 per episode, according to DigitalSpy. That was a nice uptick in pay, and it helped Gubler make millions while on the show.</p><p>According to TheList, Gubler would subsequently receive another pay increase, which brought things up to $150,000 per episode. Keep in mind that this pay does not reflect money that he has made from syndication, meaning that he certainly made a whole lot more for the episodes that have aired multiple times. TheList estimates that syndication bumped his pay to roughly $3.5 million annually.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Criminal Minds has come to an end, but Gubler has remained busy with a couple of projects.
