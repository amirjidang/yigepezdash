However, Slate has something in common with her famous Parks and Recreation character, <a href=#>Slate has led a fascinating life</a>.Unfortunately, some of the situations that Slate has gotten herself into have been pretty bizarre from the outside looking in. A perfect example of that is the weird position Slate and her ex-husband once found themselves in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenny-slate-and-her-ex-husband-wound-up-in-this-awkward-situation>Jenny Slate And Her Ex-Husband Wound Up In This Awkward Situation</h2><p>On top of being married from 2012 until 2016, Jenny Slate and her ex-husband Dean Fleischer-Camp also were collaborators. Most notably, Slate and Fleischer-Camp worked together on a movie called Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jenny Slate Went On One Of The Strangest Blind Dates In History</a></span></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A huge hit with critics</a>, Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is widely acclaimed as a truly wonderful film. Considering that Slate and Fleischer-Camp were two of the main people behind the film, they have a lot to be proud of. Slate sure has come a long way since <a href=#>her brutal SNL firing</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Slate and Fleischer-Camp came up with the characters Marcel the Shell with Shoes On is based on, they co-wrote the film's script with Nick Paley. On top of that, Fleischer-Camp directed the movie, Slate voiced the titular character, and Dean portrayed the movie's main human character.</p><p>Based on all the success Marcel the Shell with Shoes On has enjoyed, Slate and Fleischer-Camp's collaboration clearly was successful. Given the fact that the exes worked extensively on the film after their divorce, that truly is incredible.</p><p>In life, it is fairly common for exes to be forced to work together or go to school together after they split. As anyone who has gone through either of those things will know, that can be extremely uncomfortable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As bad as though situations are, however, Slate and Fleischer-Camp being the creative force behind a film for years after their divorce seems much more awkward. Keep in mind, Slate also began dating the man who is now her current husband, Ben Shattuck, during Marcel the Shell with Shoes On's production.</p><h2 id=do-jenny-slate-and-dean-fleischer-camp-get-along-after-their-divorce>Do Jenny Slate And Dean Fleischer-Camp Get Along After Their Divorce?</h2><p>In order to make the movie Marcel the Shell with Shoes On, Jenny Slate and Dean Fleischer-Camp must have spent a lot of time together. On top of that, they had to collaborate on a project that clearly meant a lot to both of them.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Defend Chris Evans’ Ex Jenny Slate Amid New Relationship Rumors</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately, a lot of divorced couples struggle to agree on anything, let alone make a series of joint decisions about something they care deeply about.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Marcel the Shell with Shoes On was released, Fleischer-Camp talked to the New Yorker about the film in 2022. During the resulting interview, Fleischer-Camp admitted that even their friends thought that he and Slate were thrust into a really awkward position.</p><p>“When we were getting divorced and still working on this, I think our friends were, like, ‘That seems very weird,’” From there, Fleischer-Camp went on to say that despite the bizarre situation he and Slate were in, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">neither of them were bothered</a>.</p><p>“It’s very easy for us to slip back into collaborator mode. We met working together, we made tons of stuff before we started dating a million years ago, and we continue to make stuff today.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, Slate was interviewed by Marie Claire. Just like Fleischer-Camp, Slate was asked about what it was like collaborating so closely with her ex-husband on Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.</p><p>Unlike Fleischer-Camp, Slate stated that working on Marcel the Shell with Shoes On with her ex-husband could be tricky. “In some ways, there are challenges that come up when you’re working with someone, and your relationship is … is making a big, big shift."</p><p>On the bright side, just like her ex-husband, Slate made it clear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">working with Fleischer-Camp after their divorce never got explosive</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"But no… It certainly wasn't dramatic or fighting or something like that. This is both of our favorite piece of work, I think, that we do, and are doing, and have done. So, I think we just wanted to keep our eye on that. We never talked about it, but I feel like both of us understood the doing the work and doing it well.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqaernq0uMCtnGagpaivorrDZpuemZ5is62xyKyaoZ2iYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnTqJuasV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
