(Bloodline, a new original series from Netflix, stars Butz alongside <strong>Kyle Chandler</strong>, <strong>Linda Cardellini</strong>, and <strong>Sissy Spacek</strong>, among others.)&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, what I hope Katie ends up with is the guy that is totally out of the business who is, I don't know, some phenomenal house painter or something out in the 'burbs [and] who is also an artist," Butz, 48, said of the Ohio native.</p><p>Any other criteria? "He should be able to dance, because she's a fabulous dancer," the actor added of the Dawson's Creek alum, 36, who memorably performed a <strong>Judy Garland</strong> tribute on a 2009 episode of Fox's So You Think You Can Dance.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Holmes needs "someone who can scoop her up and do a tango with her 'cause she's a fierce dancer," Butz told <strong>Us</strong>. "She needs a man who can get her on the dance floor."</p><p>The Giver actress was of course famously married to <strong>Tom Cruise</strong> — with whom she has an 8-year-old daughter, <strong>Suri</strong> — from 2006 to 2012. She has not seriously dated anyone in the public eye since their divorce.</p><p>Butz, for his part, is married to his former Wicked costar <strong>Michelle Federer</strong>, with whom he has a 4-year-old daughter, Georgia. He also has two kids from a previous marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakmaSesm60zqWknqtdqLWwwcudZJ2ZpJp6onnGq5yarF2Zrq%2BvxKtkp6eil7KzwIylnKhlkqrBu3nSmrCsZWJlfnaCkmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
