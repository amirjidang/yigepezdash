The team reached the postseason under Ford's ownership in 2014 and 2016.</p><p>The Lions compiled a record of 45-50-1 over Ford's six seasons as the owner, including three winning seasons over a four-year stretch from 2014 to 2017.</p><p>Although the Lions enjoyed a brief period of winning success under Ford, she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">criticized for retaining head coach Matt Patricia and general manager Bob Quinn</a> for the 2020 season. The team has finished last in the NFC North division in each of the last two seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the hiring of Quinn has brought some success on the field for the Lions. Needless to say, this is a make-or-break year for both him and Patricia, who can't afford another losing and non-playoff season.</p><p>Matthew Stafford remains one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL, while Kenny Golladay has emerged as one of the league's best wide receivers.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Report] Patrick Mahomes' Next Contract Will "Shatter Records"</a></strong></p><p>The Lions added former New England Patriots players Danny Shelton, Duron Harmon and Jamie Collins to address the defense. They also drafted future star cornerback Jeffrey Okudah with the third overall selection, so there is reason for optimism in Detroit this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Expectations aren't exactly high for the Lions entering the 2020 season, but the NFL added an additional wild card playoff team for each conference. That gives them a much better chance of qualifying for the postseason, which would go a long way in saving the jobs of Quinn and Patricia.</p><p>Tuesday&nbsp;marks&nbsp;new ownership for the Lions. Now, fans can only hope that they'll start seeing a change in on-field results as well.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">[Photo] Fan Art Depicts Colin Farrell As The Penguin For "The Batman"</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrKifp8G0ecSnq56qpJa2r7nEp6topZGnwamtjJ%2Bmq5xdqMGmvNJmm6ivnmKutHnLoqanq12kxK%2Bx0WaqoZ2Zoa5uss6rm2agkaK9bsDApJysZZ%2BrsrN7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
