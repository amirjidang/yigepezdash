The star reigned throughout the '90s on her successful radio show, that is before moving over to television. Wendy scored her very own talk show back in 2008 and has been dishing all the tea for a whopping 13 seasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering Williams made a career out of having a lot of opinions about Hollywood stars, she has also found herself in a feud or two. From shady comments, her tell-it-like-it-is attitude, all the way to Wendy's "how you doing?" the star is no stranger to a celebrity feud, so much that a few of her<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> famous tiffs will be covered in her biopic!</a></p><p>Throughout her career, TheWendy Williams Show host has gotten into it with a number of big names, including<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> her long-time feud with Bow Wow</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">50 Cent</a>. While she's moved on from a few of her past feuds, just who has Wendy Williams gone up against?</p><h2 id=mariah-carey><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Mariah Carey</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wendy-Williams-Mariah-Carey-Feud-e1614197338191.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mariah Carey</a>, who is without a doubt one of the most successful musicians of all time, has found herself going up against talk show host, Wendy Williams. The feud began way back in the 90s when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendy had accused Mariah of having work done</a> during a radio interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Wendy Williams Once Turned Down An Interview With Mariah Carey For This Reason</a></span></p><p>This obviously rubbed Mimi the wrong way, so much that Carey wrote Wendy into her no. 1 Hot 100 song, Touch My Body, referencing Wendy's nosey ways by writing, "all up in my business like a Wendy interview."</p><h2 id=whitney-houston><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Whitney Houston</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wendy-Williams-Whitney-houston-Feud.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As if one iconic singer was not enough, Wendy Williams also feuded with the late and great, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whitney Houston</a>. During Wendy's radio days, the star came for Whitney quite a bit, especially when it comes to her alleged drug use and marriage to Bobby Brown. Well, after Whitney finally agreed to an interview in 2003, things went completely awry.</p><p>During the interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Houston called Williams out</a> on her style of journalism, claiming she runs her mouth about her and many other A-listers. Despite the chaotic interview, Wendy has stood firm in her stance that she is a lifelong fan of the singers.</p><h2 id=chris-brown><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Chris Brown</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wendy-Williams-Chris-Brown-Feud-e1614197430875.jpg><p>As if Chris Brown didn't dig himself into a big enough hole come the late 2000s, it appears as if he found a way to put his foot in his mouth with Wendy Williams. In 2009, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Brown tweeted out to Wendy,</a> referring to her as a man. This has been a long-standing rumor regarding Wendy Williams, so the talk show host took the opportunity to respond back with an even bigger dig.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well, you know what? At least if I was a man I would spend my time bullying other men, perhaps, and not other women!” Wendy said, referencing Brown's domestic abuse against Rihanna.

In 1995, Wendy Williams spread a nasty rumor about the rapper, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming he was sexually assaulted</a> during his time in prison, which is was ignited the very nasty and public feud between the two.</p><p>Fans still have no clue where Wendy pulled this story out of, considering it hadn't been said from anyone or anywhere else. Following the accusation, Tupac's team released a statement, saying "it is not clear why Williams spread the rumor. She is, however, well known for making controversial statements about celebrities," which is certainly true!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lil-kim><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Lil Kim</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Lil-Kim-Wendy-Williams-Feud-e1614197608718.jpg><p>Lil Kim took a major hit from Wendy Williams when the talk show host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">went after the Crush On You rapper for her looks</a>.
