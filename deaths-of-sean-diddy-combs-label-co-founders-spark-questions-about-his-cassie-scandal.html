Alongside him were executives, Diddy, Heavy D, and Al B. Sure! (Albert Joseph Brown III). Porter also served as Harrell's assistant for a long time. She was also married to Brown from 1989 to 1990. They welcomed a son named Quincy Taylor Brown — whom Combs adopted — in 1991. After Harrell fired him from the label in 1993, Diddy founded Bad Boy Records later that same year.</p><p>Harrell died of heart failure at the age of 59 in 2020. In 2011, a 44-year-old Heavy D passed on after collapsing outside his home in Beverly Hills. Brown was also in a coma in 2022 after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple critical illnesses like renal failure</a>. "I was intubated; I was on a ventilator with a tracheotomy; I mean, there were so many things going on," he told Fox 5 New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wright thought the series of events was suspicious</a>. "Isn't that interesting?" she said of the fate of Harrell, Heavy D, Brown, and Porter. She noted that all the "survivors" and the "lates" of Uptown Records were "all writing tell-all books." She then asked: "Has Puffy ever been in a coma? Has anything happened to him? He must be the luckiest mother**ker because it seems like everybody that worked at Uptown Records from the very beginning, are gone. Just him."</p><p>Kim Porter's tell-all allegedly included salacious stories about Sean "Diddy" Combs' "gay" relationships.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>No One Knew This Rumor About Snoop Dogg Was True (Until Cameron Diaz Confirmed It)</a></span></p><h2 id=jaguar-wright-believes-diddy-39-s-ex-kim-porter-was-poisoned>Jaguar Wright Believes Diddy's Ex Kim Porter Was Poisoned</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar41870641.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In July 2020, the same month he was hospitalized, Brown wrote of Porter's death on Instagram: "I do know very clearly that #Kimberly didn't just check out all of a sudden over [pneumonia]. That’s some bull sh**. This is where I get in trouble." Wright warned that while the Porter was said to have died of pneumonia, an "initial coroner's report [...] said that it was ruled homicide and they found toxins in her body to prove that she had been poisoned."</p><p>Combs' ex-bodyguard Gene Deal also revealed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Porter once slashed the rapper's wrist as self-defense</a>. "One night, when they were at home, at Kim’s house […] he wanted to, you know, put his hands on her in the wrong way," he told TheArt of the Dialogue in October 2023. "And Kim took one of those corkscrews and ripped his wrists up. And she hit an artery. And when she did that, he had to rush over to St. Luke’s Hospital."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are a few of Diddy's controversial relationships:</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Year</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Girlfriend</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>Scandal</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>1999-2001</p></td><td><p>Jennifer Lopez</p></td><td><p>The couple were charged over possession of a stolen gun</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>'90s; reconciled in 2003; finally split in 2007</p></td><td><p>Kim Porter</p></td><td><p>Child support legal battle; Combs started dating JLo while they were still together</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2007 (on-and-off until 2018)</p></td><td><p>Cassie Ventura</p></td><td><p>Combs settled after Ventura filed a lawsuit accusing him of being controlling, violent, and abusive</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>2018-2019</p></td><td><p>Gina Huynh</p></td><td><p>Huynh alleged Combs of physically abusing her and paying her $50,000 to get rid of her pregnancy, twice</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mariah Carey Faced Lawsuits For 'All I Want For Christmas' But She's Still Making Millions Per Year From The Song</a></span></p><h2 id=cassie-feared-for-her-life-while-dating-sean-quot-diddy-quot-combs>Cassie Feared For Her Life While Dating Sean "Diddy" Combs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar47964370.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In documents filed by Ventura to the federal court in New York City, she said that she "was held down by Mr. Combs and endured over a decade of his violent behavior and disturbed demands." She stayed in their toxic relationship in fears that Diddy would hurt her career or her loved ones. "All aspects of Ms. Ventura’s life were controlled by either Mr. Combs or his management companies," the complaint stated.</p><p>Whenever she attempted to "escape his tight hold over her life," his associates would only track her down. As a result, "She found herself becoming numb to the abuse she was experiencing, and became entirely beholden to Mr. Combs's demands. She began to blindly follow his instructions out of fear of again being on the receiving end of a vicious beating."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Combs' lawyer said that the Last Night hitmaker's "decision to settle the lawsuit does not in any way undermine his flat-out denial of the claims. He is happy they got to a mutual settlement and wishes Ms. Ventura the best." Ventura reportedly demanded $30 million, but there is no confirmation that it was met in the settlement.</p><p>Jaguar Wright believes Cassie Ventura and Kim Porter "had a sit-down" before the latter died.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibnpmkncBuu8Vmqp6ZnmKxqrDDsmScp52XwG64wJucpWWTpHqnu9Snm56qo2LAsa3RpGSqrZWowaq7zaxkmpqfqsFutMisZJyZo6i2pnnSnJinnJGhfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
