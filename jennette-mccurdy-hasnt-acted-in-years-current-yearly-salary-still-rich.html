Ever since the release of her memoir "I'm Glad My Mom Died," McCurdy has opened up about the raw details of her toxic relationship with her late parent. Releasing this book was a huge deal professionally and personally for the former child star. While <a href=#>McCurdy turned down an extra $300,000</a> when she got her book deal, she still made a fortune. She continues to <a href=#>talk about her mother on her podcast</a> and in interviews.</p><p>Considering some of Jennette McCurdy's acting experiences, like feeling <a href=#>anxiety about eating food on Sam & Cat</a>, it makes sense that she decided to stop acting a few years ago. But even though she hasn't been on a movie or TV set in a long time, McCurdy is still earning an impressive amount of money.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-is-jennette-mccurdy-39-s-net-worth-and-how-does-she-make-money>What Is Jennette McCurdy's Net Worth And How Does She Make Money?</h2><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennette McCurdy has a $3.5 million net worth</a></strong>, according to Celebrity Net Worth, which is fairly high given the fact that she doesn't act anymore. While the majority of McCurdy's net worth seems to have come from the salary that she earned when acting, her current main source of income seems to be her book deals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/everything-jennette-mccurdy-revealed-about-her-mom-on-her-hard-feelings-podcast.jpg><p>In 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennette McCurdy talked about money</a> in an interview on The Financial Diet. When the subject of residuals came up, she said:</p><p>"I would make an episodic salary. OK. And usually, I'd get some sort of a bonus if we got picked up for another season. However-- and I think people might be surprised to learn this-- zero residuals."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She continued, "So for network television, you make residuals when an episode airs any time, I believe, after the first airing and every time after that. And if it's picked up from, like, a Friends-- the Friends series might be picked up on TBS, and then they're airing reruns on TBS, and also on whatever other network. But for Nickelodeon, you do not see residuals."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/The-Worst-Things-Jennette-McCurdys-Mom-Did-To-Her_-According-To-The-Star.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Worst Things Jennette McCurdy's Mom Did To Her, According To The Star">The Worst Things Jennette McCurdy's Mom Did To Her, According To The Star</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>After Jennette McCurdy's mom passed away, the former Nickelodeon star revealed her mother forced her to act against her will.</p><p>While <strong>Jennette McCurdy doesn't receive residuals </strong>from starring in iCarly and Sam & Cat, she has earned a lot of money from her books. In October 2022, Just Jared and other sources reported that <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McCurdy signed a two-book deal</a> for seven figures</strong>.

Based on the fact that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stars often sign book deals for millions</a>, as Buzzfeed noted, she likely did very well.
