The comically long list of girlfriends sitcom Jerry had throughout the show. While Jerry was dating during the series, his relationship drama was fairly limited to the time he dated a 17-year-old and then the time his now-wife left her new husband for him. But sitcom Jerry enjoyed tons of different relationships, though ultimately, none of them worked out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jerry-had-many-notable-celebrity-girlfriends-on-seinfeld>Jerry Had Many Notable Celebrity Girlfriends On Seinfeld</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/88b622e0f4e43f4570485ead6145137c.png><p>Over the course of Seinfeld's many episodes, Jerry Seinfeld had tons of love interests. Many of the episodes were centered on his relationship exploits, which didn't always end well. And while his co-stars got their share of romantic subplots, things often centered on Jerry.</p><p>Of course, things didn't usually go well for Jerry. Thanks to mix-ups, lies, and misunderstandings, plenty of his relationships ended poorly on screen.</p><p>Sometimes, the relationships ended inexplicably; <a href=#>Jerry even broke up with the perfect girlfriend, Marcia Brady</a>. He also notably ruffled <a href=#>Teri Hatcher, whose resulting mic-drop moment</a> made her even more famous.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even Jerry's most iconic girlfriends, like <a href=#>award-winning Marlee Matlin</a>, only last a single episode. So how many girlfriends did Jerry have on Seinfeld? A lot.</p><h2 id=how-many-different-girlfriends-did-seinfeld-have-on-the-show>How Many Different Girlfriends Did Seinfeld Have On The Show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/teri-hatcher-as-sidra-holland-on-seinfeld.jpg><p>Based on information from the DVD release of Seinfeld, <strong>Jerry had at least 73 girlfriends throughout the series</strong>. Not all of them appeared on-screen (some were only alluded to), and most of Jerry's relationship with Elaine was pre-series.</p><p>It's not clear if Elaine is included in that figure, either, but because many single-episode off-screen girlfriends are also included in the count, it can be assumed Elaine is, too. Elaine is also romantically involved with Jerry in between his other relationships, so she could 'count' more than one time in that sense.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But with 73 girlfriends over the course of the show's 180 episodes, Jerry has a new girlfriend, on average, about every two to three episodes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Seinfeld Actress That Lost Her Chance To Be The Main Star Because Of Too Many Suggestions</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Jerry, by the time the season finale came around, it was said that he had broken up with his fianc√©e Jeannie, and he ends the series single. It's not clear how many actual years pass in the Seinfeld universe, as it's seemingly left intentionally ambiguous, but of course, the true time elapsed would be nine years.</p><p>With that in mind, if Jerry had about eight girlfriends a year, that might not be too crazy if he dated each for a short amount of time.</p><p>Similarly, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elaine had 50 boyfriends throughout the series</a>, which is also a high number of romantic partners, though it made for great sitcom TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=how-many-of-seinfeld-39-s-girlfriends-lasted-more-than-one-episode>How Many Of Seinfeld's Girlfriends Lasted More Than One Episode?</h3><p>A handful of Jerry's relationships last longer than one episode on Seinfeld. Apart from Elaine, Jerry also dates Vanessa, Marla (Jane Leeves), Tia, Dolores, Rachel, and Jeannie (Janeane Garafalo) for multiple episodes.</p><p>In most cases, however, Jerry only dates his "girlfriends" for a single episode. Even his longer relationships spanned about two episodes on average.</p><h2 id=who-was-seinfeld-39-s-longest-relationship-with-on-the-show>Who Was Seinfeld's Longest Relationship With On The Show?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/D49169A9-61BF-4DFE-A983-AC060E821523.jpeg><p>Most of Jerry's relationships in Seinfeld were short-lived and many lasted only a single episode. And sure, it made sense for bigger celebrities to only appear once to create buzz both for the show and their careers, but even lesser-known (at the time) characters would ride off into the sunset.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One single girlfriend of Jerry's appeared in four different episodes, making her the longest relationship Jerry ever had on screen. That girlfriend was "Rachel Goldstein," played by Melanie Smith.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melanie appeared in three different episodes</a>, one of them a two-parter. Rachel entered the series during season five, episode 18, and appeared in "The Raincoats" (the two-episode series), "The Hamptons," and "The Opposite."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Is How Much Of Jerry Seinfeld's Earnings Actually Came From 'Seinfeld'</a></span></p><p>Ultimately, Rachel dumps Jerry and he doesn't really mind. Why would he, though, when in the next season's first episode, he gets to date a Miss America contestant? Marguerite MacIntyre played Karen for a single episode, but it wasn't terrible for her career; she went on to enjoy various TV gigs, including long-running roles on both Kyle XY and The Vampire Diaries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Melanie Smith enjoyed a similar trajectory; even before Seinfeld, she enjoyed a long run on As the World Turns, then later appeared on various TV shows like Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and The Division.</p><p>As for the central cast of Seinfeld, all have gone on to enjoy plenty of success, although none have been quite as lucky as Jerry in terms of wealth.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9doq6vxYydoJ%2Belaeyr8CMoKCrpJantqa6w6xknaGUYsCmtc2fnKWcXZ2ut7GMqKVmrJiaerS0zrBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
