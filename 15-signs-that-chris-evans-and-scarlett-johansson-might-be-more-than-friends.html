In Hollywood and in the celebrity world, that’s almost unheard of. That’s because you tend to hear more stories of how co-stars usually fall in love on the set of their films, have passionate romances and break up in the same dramatic matter. Yet, with Scarlett and Chris, it seems to be the opposite. They have managed to build a strong friendship in an industry in which a two-year marriage can seem like a lifetime for some people.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, no one really knows what is going on behind closed doors between Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans. Sure, they are best friends, but they are also two people who are incredibly attractive, talented, successful, and fun to be around. A lot of people think that it’s only a matter of time before the truth really comes out about their friendship and how “chummy” they are when the cameras are not looking. With that being said, here are 15 reasons why fans think Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans might be more than just friends.</p><h2 id=they-ended-their-relationships-at-the-same-time><strong>They Ended Their Relationships At The Same Time</strong></h2><p>For a lot of celebrity observers, the timing of Scarlett’s divorce from her ex Romain Dauriac and Chris Evans’ breakup with girlfriend Jenny Slate just seemed way too convenient. Scarlett and Chris single and at the same time? Is there something going on behind closed doors that we simply don’t know about? What are these two cool kids hiding from the rest of us?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elite Daily even had this to say about the timing: “Since it has now been approximately three months since the news of ScarJo's divorce from Romain Dauriac dropped, I'm assuming that's why there's now suddenly totally unfounded rumors she's dating Chris Evans. Yep, this explanation makes sense to me! Especially because, on top of ScarJo being recently single, Chris Evans, too is back on the market.”</p><h2 id=all-of-those-dating-rumors><strong>All Of Those Dating Rumors</strong></h2><p>Chris Evans has a little black list of female celebrities that he likes to keep in his pocket. That’s because the man has basically dated everyone under the sun. Pop Sugar wrote, “Unlike his squeaky-clean alter-ego Captain America, Chris Evans isn't afraid to have a little fun. Knowing that, it should come as no surprise that the self-proclaimed "ass man" has been romantically linked to quite a few of Hollywood's brightest stars.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of those women include Gisele Bündchen, Jessica Biel, Sandra Bullock, Kate Bosworth, Christina Ricci, Kristen Cavallari, Amy Smart, and Dianna Argon. But for some reason Scarlett Johansson’s name is not on that list, which has a lot of people wondering: what’s going on between these two? Chris can easily date any woman in the celebrity world, but he refuses to romance one of the most beautiful women on the planet? Inquiring minds want to know.</p><h2 id=the-rumors-just-won-t-go-away><strong>The Rumors Just Won’t Go Away</strong></h2><p>And no, the Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson dating rumors just won’t go away. At least, that’s what their fans believe. There are plenty of gossip web sites and tabloid magazine articles that have fully detailed the timeline of Scarlett and Chris’ friendship and possible romance. They do it so much, that even Chris’ family gets involved by fighting off the rumors on the internet. Apparently, his mother isn’t too pleased about some of the things that have been written about him and Scarlett in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to E! Online, Chris Evans once said, “The internet is a big place where a lot of people can voice their opinions, and my mother chooses to pick fights with random people from all over the world who don't have the nicest things to say about me.”</p><h2 id=their-perfect-friendship><strong>Their Perfect Friendship</strong></h2><p>Is there such a thing as a perfect friendship? Well, it depends on who you ask. From the outside, it seems as though Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson qualify to be in that category. After all, it’s not easy working in a place like Hollywood and finding people that you can rely on and trust. And if there’s someone who knows the feeling all too well, it’s Scarlett. That’s why she often uses Chris as a shoulder to cry on when she needs him.</p><p>People Magazine reports Scarlett Johansson as saying, “LA's a very hard place to be unless you have people there that love you. It can be very, very lonely, and it can eat you up if you don't take care of yourself. In LA, nobody wants to talk to each other, everybody's giving each other catty looks.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-great-co-stars-too><strong>They Are Great Co-Stars Too</strong></h2><p>Not only do these two have a great relationship off screen, but they also have undeniable chemistry in front of the cameras, too. They’ve worked with each other on several different films and the chemistry between Scarlett and Chris just seems to get better each time. Seriously, these two were made for one another. Just give up the charades already, kids. Something has got to give!</p><p>Scarlett told Variety in an interview, “We got to see one another grow in many ways and change. [Captain America: The Winter Solider] was the first time I had ever worked with him where he was the male lead. Chris is the only actor I can imagine playing the character. He makes something that could feel stale feel fresh. I don’t know how he does it.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-have-a-long-history><strong>They Have A Long History</strong></h2><p>Very few fans know that Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans actually have a long history with one another. That’s right – they’ve been making movies long before they became Avengers stars and long before they became household names, too. Talk about some serious friendship goals. These two set the standard!</p><p>The L.A. Times reported back in 2014, “Evans and Johansson first appeared on screen together 10 years ago in the high school heist film The Perfect Score. They also both appeared in 2007’s The Nanny Diaries — she starred in the chick-lit adaptation; Evans played the love interest character dubbed the Harvard Hottie. It was Johansson who originated her current Marvel persona first, in 2010’s Iron Man 2, while Evans arrived in Joe Johnston’s 2011 World War II-era Captain America: The First Avenger."</p><h2 id=they-have-amazing-chemistry><strong>They Have Amazing Chemistry</strong></h2><p>Before we get into this, let’s get this out of the day: both Scarlett and Chris are very much admired in Hollywood. And not only are they incredibly good looking, but they’ve also got amazing on screen chemistry, and you can’t say that about a lot of Hollywood co-stars out there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about their on screen chemistry, Chris told the L.A. Times,&nbsp;“I think that’s what makes it more dynamic. It’s what makes it more similar to life. Not every single male and female bond is going to be rooted in romance. Sometimes movies make things too perfect.”</p><p>“But the chemistry is there, which is important,” Johansson added in the same interview. “Just because they’re not romantically involved doesn’t mean that they’re not still attracted to each other as people. I like that the door is open a little bit.”</p><h2 id=others-see-their-chemistry-too><strong>Others See Their Chemistry&nbsp;Too</strong></h2><p>Yes, we’ve got eyes and we know how to use them, too. And apparently, so do the people in the entertainment industry. Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evan’s undeniable chemistry is one of the reasons why movie producers keep pairing them up in films together. That’s because they know that these two are box office gold together. People want to see them with one another, both on and off screen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Why I think their chemistry is so good together is they’re very close friends,” Joe Russo said in a separate interview with The L.A. Times back in 2014. “They brought a lot of their own ideas to their scenes and a lot of personal energy to those scenes to create what we like to call a work wife/work husband relationship between those two characters.”</p><h2 id=they-have-similar-interests><strong>They Have Similar Interests</strong></h2><p>Some of the best relationships and marriages have started out as friendships. A lot of people would say that this is a proven fact. And what makes Chris and Scarlett stand out so much is that they actually have similar interests, habits and lifestyles. In other words, both are very laid-back and prefer to do everyday things that have nothing to do with Hollywood.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Entertainment Tonight, Chris once said, “Fame is a funny thing. I like doing normal things. I like going to fairs. I like going to ball games. I like going to Disney World or a big field on the Fourth of July and having picnics with friends. The problem is you're either worried you're going to be recognized, or you're thankful you're not. It's always there.”</p><h2 id=they-often-hit-the-town-together><strong>They Often Hit The Town Together</strong></h2><p>Not only do Chris and Scarlett enjoy working with each other, they also like to socialize during after hours, too. As a matter of fact, they’ve been spotted hitting the town by the paparazzi on numerous occasions, especially when they are filming a movie on location together. And yet, they want us to believe that they’ve never been more than just friends. Uh-huh. We see you two together. I mean, how many “friendly” meals can these two have without letting the cat out of the bag?</p><p>Atlanta’s AJC.com wrote back in 2017, “The two dined at Umi in Buckhead this week and feasted on crispy rice, avocado salad, shimaaji aburi, otoro tartare, a spicy tuna box and an Umi steak. Johansson sipped a margarita and Evans chose Jameson Irish Whiskey.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=scarlett-can-t-stay-single><strong>Scarlett Can’t Stay Single</strong></h2><p>We’ve said this before and we will say it again: Scarlett Johansson is one person who just can’t stay single for a long period of time. She’s one Hollywood star who has a long list of people that she’s dated in the industry. From Sean Penn to Colin Jost, she always needs a man by her side. But insiders close to Scarlett insist that she and Chris have never been a thing, despite them spending a lot of time together after her divorce from Romain Dauriac. And yet, here we are giving her a side eye for not telling the truth.</p><p>E! News wrote, “Scarlett just got separated from Romain and is still dealing with the fact that now she’s had two failed serious relationships. She’s not trying to rush into anything and is just chilling.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=is-chris-her-secret-crush><strong>Is Chris Her Secret Crush?</strong></h2><p>Scarlett Johansson has said that if there’s one thing she loves the most, it’s having a secret crush. She just loves the air of mystery behind secretly checking out someone, but without the creepiness of course. According to Brainy Quotes, Scarlett said, “It's nice to have a crush on someone. It feels like you're alive, you know?” She has also said, “I believe in finding a soul mate. I've always been in monogamous relationships. I would never want to be in an open one. It'd be too awful. Monogamy can be hard work for some people. I don't think it applies to everybody, and I don't think a lot of people can do it.”</p><p>One can only wonder if she was thinking of Chris Evans while she said all of this, right?</p><h2 id=she-feels-comfortable-with-him><strong>She Feels Comfortable With Him</strong></h2><p>You know you’ve got it made when you work with someone that you feel absolutely comfortable with. Luckily for Scarlett, she has an incredible comfort level with Chris Evans and she doesn’t try to cover it up, either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Scarlett doesn’t even mind going makeup free in front of him, which is something that other stars would dare never do. The Daily Mail wrote back in 2014, “Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans will once again team up on the silver screen to battle the forces of evil - this time in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, due out this April. The 29-year-old actress and 32-year-old actor were seen on the set of Captain America in Los Angeles on Monday&nbsp;– there to re-shoot some scenes. Both stars were dressed very casually, with Scarlett showing off her striking features, make-up free.”</p><h2 id=they-are-just-too-perfect-for-each-other><strong>They Are Just Too Perfect For Each Other</strong></h2><p>Let’s face it: Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans are just too darn perfect for each other. They are great co-stars, Hollywood associates and lifetime friends. And not only are they great to stare at all day (thanks to their attractiveness) but they are fun to be around, too. Chris once pranked Scarlett during a memorable moment on a talk show. It was a scene that fans still can’t forget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hello Magazine reported in 2015, “Scarlett, who plays Black Widow in the new Avengers: Age of Ultron film, was on The Ellen DeGeneres Show when Chris pranked Scarlett by creeping up behind her to shout her name in her ear. The prank, set up by Ellen who is famed for her practical jokes, causes Scarlett to scream in shock and leaving the audience laughing uproariously.”</p><h2 id=some-think-it-s-only-a-matter-of-time><strong>Some Think It's&nbsp;Only A Matter Of Time</strong></h2><p>There’s been speculation for quite some time now that Scarlett and Chris’ on screen characters would eventually hook up. And at the same time, a lot of people think it’s only a matter of time before Chris and Scarlett hook up off screen, too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking about their characters, Chris said, according to Comicbook.com,&nbsp;"There's a void that they each fill for each other, and I think they've each kind of each had to face a little bit of a kind of destruction of a belief system along the way and I think they've each leaned on one another for different reasons. I think in a lot of ways Cap certainly looks up to Black Widow. I think she's always been a little wiser, a little more experienced, a little more callous in the way the world really is, and I think in Civil War Steve Rogers had to learn the hard way that things that you're banking on don't always...sometimes let you down, and I think in the last couple of years before we pick up in this film they've really kind of become this rock for one another, but I don't know if it ever bleeds into a romance."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWLAqrPNrGStoJGpeqS00aKqZp2mlru0ecCnm2ark5a%2FrbHTrWSjp5iWu7S%2FzqdkpqGXncFursRmpKiqlWLBqa3NZp2roZWjsbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
