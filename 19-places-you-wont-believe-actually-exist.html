Whether it's natural formations like Mount Roraima and the Black Forest or man-made wonders like the Tunnel of Love or&nbsp;Rådhuset&nbsp;metro station, these places have to be seen to believe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't let your eyes deceive you, though. While these places may look like something out of a fairytale or sci-fi movie--or even something wholly Photoshopped--we assure you: they're real. And, best of all, you can visit most of them. File away this list if you're planning world travel soon.</p><p>Read on for our list of 19&nbsp;places on Earth that don't look real--but are!</p><h2 id=19-zhangye-danxia-national-geographic-park---china>19.&nbsp;Zhangye Danxia National Geographic Park&nbsp;- China</h2><p>via: www.huffingtonpost.com</p><p>These pretty hills couldn't be real, right? Well, they are! You can find them in the Zhangye Danxia National Geographic Park in the&nbsp;northwestern Gansu province of China. The hills&nbsp;feature colorful deposits of sandstone, called Danxia landforms, that have been forming for 24 million years. Although these aren't the only Danxia in China, they were voted the most beautiful according to Chinese National Geography.</p><p></p><h2 id=mount-roraima---venezuela-brazil-guyana>18. Mount Roraima - Venezuela, Brazil, Guyana</h2><p>via: climax-magazine.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Like something out of a fantasy novel, the flat summit of Mount Roraima hovers above the clouds, 1,300 feet from the lands below. Though over 80% of this mountain--a part of a chain of&nbsp;plateaus--resides in Venezuela, it's actually at the point where Venezuela, Brazil and Guyana meet. Still, if you want to hike up to the summit with the other hardcore backpackers, you'll have to come up from the Venezuelan side.</p><p></p><h2 id=tunnel-of-love---klevan-ukraine>17. Tunnel of Love - Klevan, Ukraine</h2><p>via: picsdownloadz.com</p><p>While you're in Klevan, Ukraine, visiting the historic Klevan Castle or the Church of Nativity, don't miss the Tunnel of Love. Tourists can take a walk through this lush, overgrown tunnel as they whisper sweet-nothings into each others' ears. The tunnel is 3 kilometers long--just enough time to propose.</p><p></p><h2 id=bioluminescent-bay---vieques-puerto-rico>16. Bioluminescent Bay - Vieques, Puerto Rico</h2><p>via: le-citydeluxe.com</p><p>No, this isn't a scene from Life of Pi. Located in Vieques, Puerto Rico, the Bioluminescent Bay features real micro-organisms that glow neon blue&nbsp;at night, especially when the water is jostled. You can even rent a kayak to float through the glowing sea at night. Don't forget your camera!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=black-forest---southwest-germany>15. Black Forest - Southwest Germany</h2><p>via: imgur.com</p><p>There's a lot to do in the Black Forest mountain range located in the southwest corner of Germany. But, if you're dazzled by the colorful picture above, then you're probably there for the forest itself. Spring, summer and autumn are the best times for hiking, although you'll only see flowers like these in the spring.</p><p></p><h2 id=hitachi-seaside-park---hitachinaka-japan>14. Hitachi Seaside Park -&nbsp;Hitachinaka, Japan</h2><p>via: panoramio.com</p><p>As a visitor of Hitachi Seaside Park, you can walk among the Bassia scoparia, colorful bushes that turn bright red in the fall.

Visitors that aren't&nbsp;into walking can see the colorful plants from atop the amusement park ferris wheel.</p><p></p><h2 id=hobbiton-movie-set---matamata-new-zealand>13. Hobbiton Movie Set&nbsp;- Matamata, New Zealand</h2><p>via: afar.com</p><p>New Zealand is known for its beautiful landscapes as well as for the filming of the Lord of the Rings.

You can wander the gardens and visit the Hobbiton, home to Frodo and the Shite. This wonder located in Matamata is one of the most magical places to see.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=lake-hillier---middle-island-australia>12. Lake Hillier - Middle Island, Australia</h2><p>via: ilovetraveling.org</p><p>No, this isn't a camera trick or a healthy dose of Photoshop magic--this pink lake is real! The Australian lake, 600 meters long, is a bit of a mystery. Scientists haven't come up with a definitive reason why this salt lake is pink, but they do have plenty of theories.</p><p>Fun fact:&nbsp;This isn't the only pink lake in the world, many countries&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Senegal, Canada, Spain and Azerbaijan also have pink lakes.</p><p></p><h2 id=camel-thorn-trees---naukluft-park-namibia>11. Camel Thorn Trees - Naukluft Park, Namibia</h2><p>via: photography.nationalgeographic.com</p><p>This picture looks like a painting. After all, how could something so colorful and graphic be real?

Cave Metro Station - Stockholm, Sweden</h2><p>via: architizer.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Imagine going into the subway&nbsp;train station on your way to your next destination--and all of a sudden you're shocked that you are in an underground cave. That was the reaction designers were looking for when they designed&nbsp;the Rådhuset&nbsp;metro station, located in Stockholm, Sweden, to look like a colorful and artistic cavern. Do you think the locals are used to it by now?</p><p></p><h2 id=flathead-lake---montana-usa>9. Flathead Lake - Montana, USA</h2><p>via: snopes.com</p><p>The largest American freshwater lake west of the Mississippi River happens to be located in Northwest Montana. Flathead Lake has a surface area of nearly two miles. When the water is still, the water is so clear that you can see all the way to the bottom--hence why this lady looks as if she's floating in mid-air. If you want to swim in a trippy place, this is always a good choice.</p><p></p><h2 id=8-chand-baori---abhaneri-india>8.&nbsp;Chand Baori - Abhaneri, India</h2><p>via: commons.wikimedia.org</p><p>Your eyes aren't playing tricks on you. Chand Boari in Abhaneri, India is just as epic as it seems. With 3,500 steps and 13 stories, this super deep stepwell was built between 800 and 900 AD by King Chanda. While it was originally used as a well, it's now a popular attraction for tourists.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=7-grand-prismatic-spring---wyoming-usa>7.&nbsp;Grand Prismatic Spring - Wyoming, USA</h2><p>via: krysiahaag.com</p><p>Though it looks like something you'd find on another planet, the Grand Prismatic Spring is located right here on Earth.

The locally-named Door to Hell near Derweze, Turkmenistan is a fiery hole in the ground that has been burning steadily for over four decades with no signs of stopping.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>via: unknownworld.co.uk</p><p>That's because the workers in charge of the underground natural gas fields thought it was safer to burn it off in 1971 rather than risk workers trying to extract it.</p><p></p><h2 id=real-world-silent-hill---centralia-pennsylvania>4. Real-World Silent Hill - Centralia, Pennsylvania</h2><p>via: es.wikipedia.org</p><p>Fans of the video game series Silent Hill are well aware of the spooky atmosphere of the foggy town where some serious horrors occur. But, you may be surprised to know that the fictional town of Silent Hill is actually based on a real near-ghost town&nbsp;Centralia, Pennsylvania. Why all the smoke seeping out of cracks around town? A local underground coal mine caught&nbsp;on fire in 1962 and wasn't fully extinguished, causing the roads to be smoking ever since.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-crystal-cave---skaftafell-iceland>3.&nbsp;Crystal Cave - Skaftafell, Iceland</h2><p>via: travel.aol.co.uk</p><p>One look at the Crystal Caves of Skaftafell, Iceland, and you'll think you're in another world.

You can see these ice caves in person during the winter months.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>via: tortuga.ipdisk.co.kr</p><p>There are tours that give you all the winter gear you need, as well as a guide.</p><p></p><h2 id=tulip-fields---holland-netherlands>2. Tulip Fields - Holland, Netherlands</h2><p>via: popsugar.com</p><p>This is just one of many colorful and amazing pictures of the tulip fields in Holland.
