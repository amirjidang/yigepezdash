On Sunday (Feb. 4), the legendary comedian brought home the Grammy award for Best Comedy Album, marking his fifth win in the category.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">This year’s win is for his Dave Chappelle: What’s in a Name? album, the coinciding project for the 2022 release of his Netflix special of the same name. The Chappelle’s Show creator was up against Wanda Sykes, Sarah Silverman, <a href=#>Chris Rock</a>, and Trevor Noah. Noah is also serving as the host of the 66th Annual <a href=# id=auto-tag_grammy-awards data-tag=grammy-awards>Grammy Awards</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Best Comedy Album is an accolade awarded by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences of the United States to “honor artistic achievement in comedy.” The honor was awarded yearly from 1959 to 1993, and then from 2004 to present day.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Last year, Chappelle also won Best Comedy Album for his 2021 special, The Closer. Although the release was met with critical acclaim, the segment was also heavily criticized for his jokes about the transgender community.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The <a href=#>50-year-old talent </a>is still keeping tabs on the world of comedy today, as he recently shared his commentary on<a href=#> Katt Williams’ bombshell interview</a> with Shannon Sharpe on Club Shay Shay. Chappelle called out Williams for only criticizing fellow Black comedians and “drawing ugly pictures.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“What part of the game is this? He only ethered ni**as. He didn’t say anything about any of these white boys. None of these white boys function like that,” Chappelle said of Williams during his set on stage at MonDERAYS at the Hollywood Improv. “Katt is one of the best painters in the game. So why are you drawing ugly pictures of us? Stop.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Hurt people hurt people, but I am a hurt person that never hurt people, and he does it all the time: ‘F**k this one, and f**k that one, and f**k this one,’” Chappelle continued, impersonating Williams.
