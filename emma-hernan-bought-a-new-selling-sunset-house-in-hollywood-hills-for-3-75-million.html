She also serves as the CEO of her own successful food company, Emma-Leigh & Co, all of which bring immense value to her clients in each and every real estate transaction Emma Hernan has denied a rekindling of her relationship with Peter Cornell, the “Selling Sunset” star and her onetime fiancée are still professional partners, teaming up to purchase pricey Los Angeles real estate. The Oppenheim Group realtors already own a prime Hollywood Hills home that they picked up for $2.7 million several years ago, and now the budding investors have ponied up additional big bucks for a stylishly revamped residence near the Bird Streets neighborhood.</p><p>As per <a href=#>Dirt</a>, Records show Hernan and Cornell — she also the CEO of plant-based frozen food brand <a href=#>Emma-Leigh & Co.</a>, he a former pro basketball player — co-paid about $3.8 million for the place, which was originally listed for a speck under $4 million. Built in the early 1950s, but since extensively renovated, the Hamptons-esque house features three bedrooms and two baths in almost 2,400 square feet of modernized, all-white living space boasting rich hardwood floors, decorative moldings and designer light fixtures throughout.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show revolves around a dozen women working for The Oppenheim Group, a real estate brokerage founded in 1889 and currently headed by Jason Oppenheim. The chic realtors are filmed showing multimillion-dollar houses to wealthy clients, driving around in flashy cars, and dining out throughout the day.</p><p><span class=related-single><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href=#><strong>After Buying A $23 Million Estate, Conan O’Brien Beach House Has Been Finally Sold For $16.5 Million</strong></a></span></p><p>But one of the realtors working at The Oppenheim Group, Emma Hernan, told Insider in an interview that the job isn't full of the glitz and glam that viewers might expect.</p><p>"What everyone doesn't see is that I'm crawling in a small space trying to see if the house is okay for inspections," Hernan said.</p><p>Despite being filmed wearing stylish outfits, Hernan said behind the scenes she has to wear a hard hat when attending house inspections in order to help out the construction team, per <a href=#>Insider</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The last property that I listed, I created the garden because I needed it to look perfect for staging," Hernan said.

The true amount of daily showings have to be cut down because only so much can fit into one episode, she added.</p><p>In reality, the Oppenheim Group realtors are running around LA, attending back-to-back house viewings, and meeting clients, Hernan said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/8AA2DF58-65D3-483A-A88F-F0B4BC6274F0.jpeg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Imagine trying to schedule to see 10 houses a day, scheduling them every 30 minutes, and then one of the agents changes the time," she said. "It's a lot of hard work."</p><p>Filming, which can last from three hours to 10 hours or more per day, means that Hernan can often work 15-hour days. Although it takes up a lot of time, Hernan, who is also the CEO of her own plant-based food company, said she's able to focus on other work during filming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/AF49B83B-A981-4E56-A574-F775B86E8426.jpeg><p>"I worked my butt off to get where I am today," Hernan said. She added that her biggest real estate deals came in at $15 million and $19 million. "I would definitely be the star of the circus for my juggling skills."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Resting on a fully hedged parcel spanning nearly a quarter-acre, the single-story structure is accessed via a gated doorway out front or gated driveway tucked off to the side that curves around to an attached two-car garage.
