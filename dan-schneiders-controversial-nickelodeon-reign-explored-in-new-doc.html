According to the synopsis, Quiet on Set “reveals an insidious environment rife with allegations of abuse, sexism, racism, and inappropriate dynamics with its underage stars and crew.”</p><p>In the video, an unnamed former Nickelodeon employee compared working with Schneider to an “abusive” relationship. Another person recalled filing complaints against the executive producer for gender discrimination, creating a hostile work environment and harassment.</p><p>Schneider, who is the founder and co-president of production company Schneider’s Bakery, has helped create, write and produce hit sketch shows including All That, Drake & Josh, iCarly, Sam & Cat, The Amanda Show, Victorious and Zoey 101. <a href=#>His projects helped launch the careers</a> of <strong>Ariana Grande, Miranda Cosgrove, Amanda Bynes, Drake Bell, Josh Peck, Jamie Lynn Spears</strong> and more.</p><p>After being accused of inappropriate misconduct during <a href=#>his time at Nickelodeon</a>, Schneider parted ways with the network in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dan-Schneider-Controversial-Nickelodeon-Reign-Is-the-Focus-of-Upcoming-Doc-1.jpg><p>“Following many conversations together about next directions and future opportunities, Nickelodeon and our longtime creative partner Dan Schneider/Schneider’s Bakery have agreed to not extend the current deal,” the network said in a statement at the time.</p><p>Schneider later denied any allegations against him, telling The New York Times in July 2021, “The comedy was totally innocent. I never interacted with actors in any way, texting or otherwise, that should make anyone uncomfortable.”</p><p>The upcoming docuseries features accusations from former employees about the alleged “toxic environment” created on set by Schneider.</p><p>A rep for Schneider addressed the allegations in a statement, telling Us Weekly, “Dan cared about the kids on his shows even when sometimes their own families unfortunately did not. He understood what they were going through and he was their biggest champion. The fact is many of the kids on these shows are put in the untenable position of becoming the breadwinner for their family and the pressure that comes along with that. Add on top of that the difficulties of growing up and having to do so under the spotlight while working a demanding job, all as a child. That is why there are many levels of standards, executives, lawyers, teachers and parents everywhere, all the time, on every set, every day. However, it is still a hard place to be a kid and nobody knew that better than Dan.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Dan-Schneider-Controversial-Nickelodeon-Reign-Is-the-Focus-of-Upcoming-Doc-2.jpg><p>Quiet on Set also focus on three other men, who are referred to as “predators” in the trailer, that briefly worked at Nickelodeon.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>One of the men is <strong>Brian Peck</strong>, who appeared in episodes of All That and The Amanda Show.
