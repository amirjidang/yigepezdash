In the case of Johnny Depp's children, Lily-Rose and Jack Depp, they had each other throughout their childhood as they <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">followed their famous parents around the world.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While we know&nbsp;a lot about what goes on in Lily Rose's life, now that she has grown up into a high profile celebrity herself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we don't know much about her brother Jack.</a></p><p>We know even less about their relationship as siblings. Depp and his former partner of 14 years, Vanesa Paradis, raised their children mainly out of the public eye, so what was their childhood like together, and how is their relationship now?</p><h2 id=their-childhood-was-not-strict>Their Childhood Was Not Strict.</h2><p>Like some other celebrity children, Lily-Rose, 21, and Jack, 18, were not brought up in a strict environment. The siblings floated between France and Los Angeles growing up but were virtually left to their own devices learning who they wanted to be.</p><p>Lily-Rose explained her childhood <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with The Sun</a>. "My parents weren’t very strict. They've always trusted me to be independent and make my own decisions. There wasn’t really ­anything to rebel against.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Most Expensive Things Johnny Depp Has Purchased</a></span></p><p>"They both left school when they were 15, so they can’t really say ­anything. I never thought of university as my goal.</p><p>"I've always just wanted to work. I didn’t have any incentive to keep doing all that work."</p><p>By the sound of it, her brother has done the same thing of testing out his own artistic abilities as a child.</p><p>Speaking about his son, Depp said,&nbsp;"My boy, Jack, has always been a very talented draftsman.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp Catches Up, While Daughter Lily Might Be Shacking Up</a></span></p><p>"He draws really super well. He also plays music very well. He’s got a good feel for that. Aside from school plays and things, he hasn’t shown any desire to become an actor. Whew."</p><p>Besides letting his children have full reign to figure themselves out, Depp gave them the privacy they needed as children to do that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"My parents did a great job of giving me and my brother the most private upbringing we could have. So to value your private life and to keep it for yourself has always been important to me," Lily-Rose said.</p><p>Depp even made time out of his busy acting schedule to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">play Barbie's with his daughter</a>, when she was young. Although she didn't much like all the different voices he used to do.</p><h2 id=lily-rose-and-jack-have-a-close-relationship>Lily-Rose And Jack Have A Close Relationship.</h2><p>While there isn't much on the siblings and their relationship, we can make out that they've always been close. Through the years they've been photographed together in airports with their parents and on outings.</p><p>As his sister's modeling career has taken off over the years, Jack is sometimes seen in the crowd supporting her. In 2015, he was spotted attending Paris Fashion Week where Lily-Rose was walking for Chanel.</p><p>In return, Lily-Rose is extremely protective of her little brother and his choice to live in privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We sort of get a glimpse into their bond through their social media as well. For Jack's 18th birthday this past April, Lily-Rose posted a happy birthday message on her Instagram.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Little-Known Facts About Johnny Depp's Daughter, Lily-Rose&nbsp;</a></span></p><p>She posted a picture of them in a photobooth as kids and commented, "My little baby Jackie is 18. My baby bro my heart and soul happy birthday I love you SO MUCH!"</p><p>The post also including a recent-looking snapshot of Jack, who looks a lot like his dad, now that he's older.</p><p>In 2018, Jack was reportedly suffering from a 'serious illness.' While it is still unknown was happened, Paradis actually had to ditch a film premiere to handle the situation with her son at the time. There's no doubt that his sister was right there for him when he needed her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Currently, the pair are living with their mother in France</a> and have been quarantining together throughout the Coronavirus pandemic. Each of them has recently stepped out onto the Paris streets separately, but we know they've probably been bingeing Netflix together like the rest of us in lockdown.</p><p>Even though Lily-Rose's acting and modeling careers have skyrocketed while Jack is still living a private teenaged life, there's no doubt they'll always be as close as they've always been. Depp must be so proud.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">18 Photos Of Lily-Rose That'll Turn Johnny Depp's Cheeks Red&nbsp;</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiYp2WZo8CqsMRmo6inm2KutXnLoqOyZaKkwKZ5wKebZqKRmLhusMSpp6xlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
