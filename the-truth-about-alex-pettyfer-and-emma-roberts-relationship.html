She's the daughter of actor Eric Roberts and <a href=#>the niece of Julia Roberts</a>. Now, her son, <a href=#>Rhodes Robert Hedlund</a>, whom she recently <a href=#>gave birth to over quarantine</a> with <a href=#>boyfriend Garrett Hedlund</a>, will be a part of that celebrity dynasty if he chooses to follow in his family's footsteps. But Roberts could have started a family of her own with any of her exes. She was engaged to her <a href=#>American Horror Story co-star Evan Peters</a> until Roberts was <a href=#>arrested on domestic abuse charges</a> in 2013. They got back together for awhile, but called it quits for good in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, before dating Peters, Roberts dated English actor Alex Pettyfer, which <a href=#>many people don't know or forget</a>. But what happened between Roberts and Pettyfer?</p><h2 id=emma-roberts-and-alex-pettyfer-met-on-the-set-of-39-wild-child-39>Emma Roberts And Alex Pettyfer Met On The Set Of 'Wild Child'</h2><p>One of Roberts' earliest boyfriends was Alex Pettyfer, who's known for his roles in In Time, I Am Number Four, Beastly, and Endless Love. The ex-couple met on the set of Nick Moore's 2008 film, Wild Child. Roberts plays the leading lady, Poppy, and Pettyfer plays her love interest, Freddie, one of his first roles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The film's synopsis reads: "Sixteen-year-old Poppy (Emma Roberts) has everything her unlimited credit cards can buy, and a spoiled attitude to match. After a final thoughtless prank, her exasperated father (Aidan Quinn) ships her off to boarding school in England. There, Poppy meets her match in a stern headmistress (Natasha Richardson) and a class full of girls who will not tolerate her selfishness."</p><p>According to The Sun, Pettyfer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tattooed Roberts' initials on his finger</a> at some point in their relationship. However, Roberts and Pettyfer only dated for about a year, so that tattoo might have cursed their relationship. "I got a girl’s name tattooed on my ring finger because I was in love," Pettyfer told Glamour U.K. in 2010. "We’ve broken up, but I don’t live in regret." But did Pettyfer get the tattoo removed, is the question.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>This Controversial Emma Roberts Movie Was Voted The Worst Indie Film Of All Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other than that, not much else is known about Roberts and Pettyfer's relationship. Clearly, it was nothing special to Roberts because she quickly moved on. The Sun writes that Roberts was linked to her Aquamarine co-star Chord Overstreet in 2011. The ex-couple were spotted at Coachella in 2012 exchanging PDA but their relationship didn't really last because they called it quits shortly after. However, Us Weekly writes that Roberts was linked to two other men in between Pettyfer and Overstreet.</p><h2 id=emma-roberts-dated-two-men-between-alex-pettyfer-and-chord-overstreet>Emma Roberts Dated Two Men Between Alex Pettyfer And Chord Overstreet</h2><p>Roberts <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly dated pro-skateboarder, Ryan Sheckler</a>, briefly in 2009. Later that year, Roberts was linked to Dathan Kuppin, a ULCA student, but the pair split after almost two years together in 2011.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, in later 2011, Roberts started seeing Overstreet, who's famous for Glee and Aquamarine. After the first couple of months dating, they broke up, but got back together months later. However, they broke up for good later in 2012. Once again, Roberts wasn't single for very long. The same year that she left Overstreet, she started dating her American Horror Story co-star, Evan Peters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Wasn't Emma Roberts Canceled After Her Altercation With Evan Peters?</a></span></p><p>The pair actually met on the set of Adult World and later co-starred in AHS together. Trouble in paradise for the high-profile couple started in July 2013 when Roberts was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">arrested following a domestic violence incident</a> following a fight with Peters. Representatives for the couple told Us Weekly that the altercation was an "unfortunate incident and misunderstanding." Roberts was reportedly "released after questioning" and was "working together [with Peters] to move past it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They clearly did a good job of working past it, at least for a little while, because Roberts and Peters announced their engagement shortly after. However, they never made it down the aisle due to their many breaks. Ultimately, their relationship didn't survive and they first called it quits in 2016. After that, they tried another relationship again in September 2016, and Roberts started wearing her engagement ring again. But this second try didn't work either and they called it all off for good in March 2019.</p><p>In between her break from Peters from 2016 and 2019, Roberts tried dating Christopher Hines. But that didn't work out and Roberts went back to Peters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Truth About Emma Roberts' Relationship With Her Mother</a></span></p><h2 id=emma-roberts-has-found-love-with-garrett-hedlund>Emma Roberts Has Found Love With Garrett Hedlund</h2><p>After her relationship with Peters died for good, multiple sources confirmed to Us Weekly that Roberts was dating Country Strong actor, Garrett Hedlund. "Garrett and Emma have been friends, but this is new, casual, and just a couple of weeks old," a source told Us Weekly in March 2019. More than a year after, news broke that Roberts was pregnant with the couple's first child.</p><p>So Pettyfer might have been Roberts's first real high-profile relationship, but he was hardly her last. Considering all the people that Roberts has dated, it would be surprising if she even remembers her time with Pettyfer.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Emma Roberts' Really Thinks Of Starring In The 'American Horror Story' Series</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6orjEsWSpnaSpxqex0WaYp5xdmrqurYyrppudoqnAbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
