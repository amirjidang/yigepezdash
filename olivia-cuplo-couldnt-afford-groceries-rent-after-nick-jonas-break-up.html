"<a href=#>I did date Nick</a>. That was a very formative experience," she said of their relationship, which lasted from 2013 to 2015. "I had no brand, no money, and I was in love.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hurting For Cash?

Not only did the split leave her heartbroken, but also in a bad place financially.</p><p>"But when he broke up with me, I was kind of left with no sense of identity,” she explained. “My whole identity was in him, which is a very common story of a young person in love.”</p><p>Olivia continued, "I just remember night after night, looking up at my ceiling in my apartment that I couldn’t afford, thinking to myself, ‘How am I going to pay my rent?’"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I couldn’t even afford my groceries,” she added.</p><p>It’s unclear how much Nick helped out Olivia financially during their time together. But the model says she never thought about what could happen if they broke up, since she believed they would eventually get married.</p><p>The reason for Nick and Olivia’s break-up isn’t clear, but weeks before the news was announced in 2015, the singer opened up about how difficult long distance could be.</p><p>It’s just about trying to take it one step at a time,” he told <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>. “I think that the long distance thing can be tough, but try to stay in communication, keep it transparent and honest, and it should be okay.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked about whether she’d join him on his upcoming tour, Nick replied with a vague answer, implying they may have already been broken up (or he was at least planning to do it).</p><p>“For the most part when I’m on the road, I’m kind of in my thing and doing that,” he said.</p><p>Additionally, a source told the publication that the break-up was “tough” for both Nick and Olivia.</p><p>So far, Nick hasn’t responded on his ex-girlfriend’s comments. The Jonas Brother went on to marry Indian actress Priyanka Chopra in 2018. They welcomed their first child, a daughter, Malti, via surrogate in January 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nowadays, Olivia appears to be in a better financial situation. <a href=#>Distractify</a> reports that her net worth is approximately $7 million, and it stands to increase if her new TLC show takes off.</p><p>The model is currently dating NFL star Christian McCaffrey, who was recently traded from the South Carolina Panthers.
