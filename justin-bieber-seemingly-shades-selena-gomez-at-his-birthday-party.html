Getting pettier every year,” another person<a href=#> penned</a>.</p><p>Still, others felt that the sentiment was positive — or that it held a different meaning.</p><p>“Can’t believe people are interpreting this negatively. justin is saying he’s grateful for the life he has as is,” <a href=#>said</a> one fan. “Or he could be talking about something else or his mental health. be fr. its been 10 years. let it go,” <a href=#>commented</a> another user.</p><p>The Grammy winner has been married to Hailey since 2018, but continues to be involved with drama surrounding the <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a> star, 30, even five years after splitting for good following years of on-and-off relationship woes.</p><p>Gomez and Hailey, 26, raised eyebrows late last month when they appeared to be feuding via social media.</p><p>After the model and pal <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong> </a>were accused by fans of<a href=#> making fun of the Golden Globe nominee’s eyebrows</a> via social media, the Kardashians star, 25, denied the rumors via TikTok on February 23. “No shade towards selena ever,” Jenner clarified at the time, which <a href=#>Gomez acknowledged</a>. “Agreed @kyliejenner It’s all unnecessary,” she replied to the Kylie Cosmetics mogul’s comment. “I’m a fan of Kylie!”</p><p>Hours later, however, the “Wolves” songstress didn’t hold back when commenting on a resurfaced video of Hailey gagging at the mention of <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>.</p><p>“So sorry, my best friend is and continues to be one of the best in the game,” the Disney Channel alum wrote in response.</p><p>In addition to seemingly tossing his own hat in the ring amid the controversy, Justin also made a surprise appearance at the Rolling Loud music festival in Los Angeles on Saturday, March 5 — days after <a href=#>he seemingly canceled his remaining Justice World tour dates</a>.</p><p>The “Sorry” artist joined “Private Landing” collaborator<strong> Don Toliver</strong> on stage to perform their new track for the cheering crowd. Less than a week prior, eagle-eyed fans noticed that Ticketmaster marked all of Justin’s upcoming concerts in the U.S., Ireland, France, Poland, Australia, Denmark and the Czech Republic as canceled.</p><p>Though Justin and his team have yet to comment on the seemingly canceled dates, the “Ghost” singer announced in June 2022 that he would be postponing the tour amid <a href=#>his diagnosis with Ramsay Hunt syndrome</a>, which can cause temporary facial paralysis.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“This is pretty serious as you can see. I wish this wasn’t the case. But obviously, my body is telling me I need to slow down,” Justin shared in the Instagram video at the time, showing off <a href=#>the lack of movement in half of his face</a>.</p><p>“[He] has every faith this will resolve itself eventually, but of course, it’s a stressful situation to be dealing with and a tough time for both [him and Hailey] right now,” a source exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly </a>at the time of Justin’s diagnosis. “The last thing he wanted was to postpone the concerts.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajraOptq95waKcm52iYsCmscyipaCkqWLAqa3Dnqpmq5Whsq%2BtjKCmpp2qYq61eceiqmaamafBqbDAsmSpmaKpxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
