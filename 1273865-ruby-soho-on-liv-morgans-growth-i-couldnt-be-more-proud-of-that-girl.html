She was kind of put into a position where she is now on her own when she always had one of us next to her to kind of guide her. She has taken that ball and run with it so fast, nobody can see her because she is thriving right now. She is coming into her own. She is finding herself. She‘s finding her voice and her in-ring ability is at the top of its game. I told her that after her match. It’s a pleasure and an honor to be able to watch and be able to say I was a small part of her journey to see where she’s at now because she’s a star.”</p><p>Soho also spoke briefly about her friendship with WWE superstar <a href=#>Sarah Logan</a>, and how it was Sarah that actually gave the “bug” of living on a farm to both Soho and Liv Morgan.</p><p>“Sarah kind of spread the bug to all of us. She moved to a farm, the other two kind of followed,” Ruby said.</p><p>Ruby also spoke about how she’s still close with Logan and moved to Ohio to be closer to her.</p><p>“I tell a lot of people often I want you to picture that exact opposite of the lifestyle that you think I would live and that’s the lifestyle that I live. It was a pretty easy decision. I moved here in I believe February, probably closer to March of last year. I am godmother to Sarah’s son, Cash, and she asked me to be as much as part of his life as possible. I love that little boy to death and she is one of my best friends, so it was an easy choice and I was able to find this farm in the middle of nowhere and I was able to get horses and I have a place for my dogs to run around. I honestly have found this peace out here. When I’m at work, it’s go, go, go. It’s people all the time pulling me in different directions and then coming home it’s just this sense of calm that I think that I needed not just for myself, but my mental health as well.”</p><p>Ruby also spoke about how the TBS Championship has elevated the AEW women’s division; read more about her thoughts on the title at <a href=#>this link</a>.
