The trousers look identical to the ones that Giudice, 51, wore to her daughter Gia’s <a href=#>college graduation</a> in May.</p><p class=p1>“Did you borrow Teresa’s pants? She wore them to Gia’s graduation&nbsp;<span class=s1>🤣</span>,” one social media user replied on Thursday.</p><p class=p1>Another added: “Everything Tre does Melissa tries oh so hard to do better. Even down to the outfit!”</p><p class=p1>While neither&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Real Housewives of New Jersey</a>&nbsp;</i>star has addressed the wardrobe comparison, <a href=#>they have been estranged</a> since August 2022. Giudice — who <a href=#>shares four daughters</a> with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Joe Giudice</strong></a> — has had a rocky history with her brother’s wife before things reached a boiling point when <a href=#>the Gorgas opted to skip Teresa’s wedding</a> to <a href=#><strong>Luis “Louie” Ruelas</strong></a> last year. They believed that the&nbsp;<i>Turning Tables&nbsp;</i>author <a href=#>spread rumors that Melissa cheated on Joe</a> and subsequently was upset over the gossip. (The Gorgas have since <a href=#>denied the cheating accusations</a>.)</p><p class=p1>“That’s my only family. So, what do you think? Yeah, it was devastating,” Teresa<a href=#> exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly</i>&nbsp;in October 2022</a> while speaking about their absence. “I mean, the day before [my wedding],<a href=#> I was in tears</a> ‘cause I just found out [they weren’t coming]. It was&nbsp;heartbreaking [because] it’s my only family, and Luis was hurting for me. <a href=#>My children were hurting</a>. But then [on] that day, that day was our day.”</p><p class=p1>The “On Display” singer, for her part, told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>that same month that she was upset that Teresa <a href=#>excluded her as a bridesmaid</a>. “From day one with all the wedding drama, I was told on national TV I wasn’t gonna be a part of it,” <a href=#>Melissa told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>at BravoCon</a>. “I was told we are not close. I was told all of these things. So <a href=#>when you draw the line in the sand</a>, well then, I have to stand behind the line. And then don’t be upset when we’re behind the line because you drew it.”</p><p class=p1>The drama <a href=#>escalated during the&nbsp;<i>RHONJ&nbsp;</i>season 13 reunion</a>, which aired earlier this month, after Teresa accused Melissa and her brother <a href=#>of putting her in jail</a>, which they denied. (Teresa and Giudice <a href=#>went to jail for multiple fraud charges</a> in 2015.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>The siblings have since ceased communication.</p><p class=p3>“I wish them well. I swear I wish them all the best,”&nbsp;<a href=#>Teresa told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in February</a>, noting she doesn’t hold a grudge. “I need to heal myself.&nbsp;I’ve been through a lot the past 10 years with them. I’m happy for them. I wish them well and I wish they wished me the same back. I’m focusing on my family, my daughters, on my stepsons, on my husband. … And putting myself first because for a long time I haven’t put myself first. So now this is my time.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6mys7HSmmSgoaWZtqSxjKacpaGjqK5us86rnpplp6S%2FpnnSmqSeZaCWu7W%2FjK2mZqOZmcBus9Gam66ZpJ68r7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
