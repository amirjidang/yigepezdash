The costars went on to reprise their roles four years later: <a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>,<b><a href=#>&nbsp;Kim Cattrall</a></b>,&nbsp;<a href=#><b>Kristin Davis</b></a>&nbsp;and<b>&nbsp;<a href=#>Cynthia Nixon</a></b> starred in two Sex and the City films, one in 2008 and a second in 2010. However, <a href=#>the drama has never stayed on the screen</a>.</p><p>In January 2020, the cast announced that a revival series is coming to HBO Max, titled&nbsp;And Just Like That. It will follow Parker, Davis and Nixon’s characters through their 50s. Cattrall will not be part of the series.</p><p>“I couldn’t help but wonder… where are they now?” Parker wrote via Instagram at the time alongside a snippet of footage. The clip featured a few New York City sights and the words, “And just like that … the story continues,” being typed across a computer screen.</p><p>The <a href=#>Hocus Pocus</a> actress also addressed whether they were replacing Cattrall’s character in the new show, telling TMZ in January 2021, “<a href=#>We’re not looking to bring in a fourth character</a>. We have New York City as a fourth character.”</p><p>The Just Just Want to Have Fun star also claimed that <a href=#>she does not “dislike” her former costar</a>, via an Instagram post that same month. “I’ve never said that. Never would,” Parker added.</p><p>Cattrall, for her part, hasn’t <a href=#>publicly commented on the new SATC series</a>, but some of her other castmates have seemingly hinted that the feud between her and the rest of the women is still ongoing.</p><p>“I do know that I’m very close with SJ and [Cattrall’s] descriptions of her don’t even come close,” <a href=#><strong>Chris Noth</strong></a>, who plays Mr. Big in the franchise, <a href=#>told The Guardian in December 2021</a>, noting he had “no idea” what Cattrall’s thinking is at this point. “I liked [Cattrall], I thought she was marvelous in the show and some people move on for their own reasons.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued: “I don’t know what hers were. I just wish that whole thing had never happened because it was sad and uncomfortable.”</p><p>Scroll down to relive the Sex and the City cast’s ups and downs over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2Bosrl5wKebZqyYmnqktdOyZJ2qkaKubsDHq6aun5hiwamxjLKcmqqjYq5uwMimnKWhnpp8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
