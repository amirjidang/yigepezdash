However, the actor denied the actress’s request for a meeting until they ended their relationship.</p><p>Eventually, The Goldbergs star Topp’s theory proved correct; shortly after Olivia’s breakup, the couple started seeing each other as more than just friends.</p><p>Sui and the actor occasionally appear on each other’s respective Instagram accounts. The actress uploads funny photoshopped pictures on her social handle, making one laugh at the top of the lungs.</p><p>There are very few decent couple pictures and more weird pictures showing their jolly personality. They undoubtedly make a cute and funny couple on Instagram.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=olivia-and-sam-made-fans-go-crazy-with-their-pictures-in-2020></span>Olivia And Sam Made Fans Go Crazy With Their Pictures In 2020<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As funny as it can get, Olivia shared a picture of her wearing a white robe and Sam in his leopard print pajamas while having a robe belt like a leash on his neck.</p><p>Likewise, the actress shared a picture of them kissing with a photoshopped enlarged hip which appears as if Sui got a Brazilian butt lift. ‘He likes me thicc,’ Sui&nbsp;captioned&nbsp;the picture.</p><p>Besides the funny pictures, the couple also shared some excellent decent images of them having quality time in China. Sam and Sui visited China, and the actor met his girlfriend’s grandfather.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=sam-and-olivia-still-the-funny-couple-in-2021></span>Sam And Olivia Still The Funny Couple In 2021<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nothing can stop Sam and Olivia from being a funny and jolly couple.
