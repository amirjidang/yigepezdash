He was born to Frederick Bradford Weller, United States Army helicopter pilot and his beloved wife Dorothy Jean, a homemaker. His roots had nothing to do with entertainment business but yet his passion led him to the field complete opposite of his family’s. He had travelled extensively during his childhood because of his father’s requirement to fly all over the world. His family lived in Germany for many years before shifting to Texas where he had attended his high school. He then graduated from North Texas State University where he earned Bachelors of Arts in theatre.</p><p>His acting career started right after the completion of graduation. Prior to becoming a film actor, he had a distinguished theatrical career. He debuted as a determined lawman in the movie titled Butch and Sundance: The Early Days which was released on 1979. He had then appeared on numerous movies and television series. One of the highly regarded personalities, Weller has done some amazing work over the years. He is best known for his role as the lead character in the film “Robocop” (1987) which went on to became the blockbusters of that time. Besides, he’s also remembered for his commendable and fantastic performance in the films such as “The adventures of Buckaroo Banzai across the 8th dimension” and also for “Naked Lunch”. He has earned many nominations for his incredible works too.</p><p>Apart from acting, the genius also had directing skills up on his sleeves. In 1993, he earned Academy Award nominations, one of the most prestigious awards of Hollywood for his direction abilities that he showed in short Partners. He had appeared on countless television series and many people recognize him as a television personality. He’s associated with some of the popular television drama series including names like “Fringe”, “Dexter”, “Psyche” and so on.

He decided to marry pretty late but the wait was all worth it. He shares a good bond with her and enjoys a good relationship. It’s not known whether the two have any children together. However, he does have a biological daughter named Kate Linden who is a manager at Development Management Group. His professional life and his accomplishments get more priority compared to his personal life happenings. Tabloids are more interested with his career and the body of work that he has delivered over the years and they hardly get time to dig into his private life. So, basically, the veteran actor and director have accomplished great heights in his career and still at this age remain unstoppable.</p><p>To add some interesting and fun facts about him, he completed his master’s degree in Roman and Renaissance Art from Syracuse University only in 2004. And later he decided to profess about art and literature occasionally at the same university. Some other trivia includes the fact that he loves cigar smoking. He was also once engaged with actress, Sela Ward but somehow their relationship didn’t work out. He then remained single for long before exchanging wedding vows with his present wife in 2006. His basic trademarks include his deep resonant voice and his steely light blue eyes.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKiVqbKzedaeo6WdomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
