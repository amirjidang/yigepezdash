Instead, Freeman focuses on his work, which has allowed him to <a href=# rel=nofollow>work on projects where Freeman made a crazy amount of money</a> to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">amass a $250 million net worth</a>.</p><p>It is because of how hard Freeman has worked over the last several decades that he has set himself up to be very comfortable whenever he decides to retire. However, it is also the work that Freeman has recognized may have been the cause of the downfall of his relationships and marriages in the past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar53685345-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Before Freeman was married, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">he was in a relationship with a woman named Loletha Adkins</a>. In 1959, Adkins found out she was pregnant. She told Freeman and Freeman left. He did not stick around to help with the pregnancy or to get to know his child.</p><p>It was not until his child, a son named Alfonso Freeman, was 19 years old that Freeman made the effort to be in his life. While Alfonso was initially angry at Freeman for abandoning him, the two reconciled and the two have remained close over the years.</p><p>A year after Freeman got Adkins pregnant, he moved on to a relationship with another woman. That woman's name has never been revealed, but the two had a son, Saifoulaye Freeman, together in 1960.</p><p>The status of the relationship between Freeman and Saifoulaye is unknown. It is believed the two do not have much contact, given that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Saifoulaye was the only child of Freeman's who did not attend the SAG Awards in 2018</a> where Freeman was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award.

When he did, he married his first wife, Jeanette Adair Bradshaw.</p><h2 id=morgan-freeman-39-s-first-wife-was-jeanette-adair-bradshaw>Morgan Freeman's First Wife Was Jeanette Adair Bradshaw</h2><h3 id=morgan-freeman-and-jeanette-adair-bradshaw-were-married-for-12-years>Morgan Freeman and Jeanette Adair Bradshaw were married for 12 years</h3><p>Freeman and Bradshaw met sometime around 1962 in Los Angeles. The two dated for five years. During that time, Freeman essentially had a built-in family, as Bradshaw had a daughter from a previous relationship, Deena.</p><p>In 1967, Bradshaw and Freeman got married. While Freeman wanted to adopt Deena as soon as he could, there was a lot of red tape to cut through to make that happen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/morgan-freeman.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Eventually I married, so I have a stepdaughter, whom I adopted just as soon as I could," Freeman told Esquire. "There was some sort of legislative action at the time ... that stood in the way of adopting a girl. I don't remember. And the lady I first married, we had a daughter. And that's family. I guess you'd call it dysfunctional, I don't know."</p><p>Freeman was able to legally adopt Deena in 1967, and the trio became a happy family.</p><p>During the 12-year marriage, Freeman and Bradshaw welcomed a daughter, Morgana. It looked like everything was on the right track for Freeman. He had a happy home life, and he was doing well professionally. Unfortunately, in 1979, the couple got divorced.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/morgan-freeman-grandson.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>What Have Morgan Freeman's Children Been Up To?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite his not-so-good marriage record, the actor has always been a family man at heart.</span><p>After the divorce, Bradshaw, who had been a staple on the red carpet with Freeman, disappeared from the spotlight. Her current whereabouts are unknown, but it is speculated that she has a decent net worth as a result of a settlement for the divorce from Freeman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=morgan-freeman-married-again-in-1984-but-it-did-not-last>Morgan Freeman Married Again In 1984, But It Did Not Last</h2><h3 id=morgan-freeman-married-myrna-colley-lee-in-1984-but-the-two-divorced-after-16-years>Morgan Freeman married Myrna Colley-Lee in 1984 but the two divorced after 16 years</h3><p>Like Freeman, his second ex-wife, Myrna Colley-Lee, also worked successfully in the entertainment industry. However, instead of working in front of the camera, Colley-Lee worked behind the scenes as a costume designer.</p><p>It is not clear how Freeman and Colley-Lee met. But, the two married in 1984.</p><p>Shortly after the marriage, Freeman's adoptive daughter, Deena, had a daughter of her own. Deena was unable to care for her at the time and because of this, Freeman and Colley-Lee raised E'Dena Hines.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/instar41763561-1.jpg><p>During their 16-year marriage, Freeman and Colley-Lee did not have any children together. But Colley-Lee did have a great relationship with Freeman's kids. Between that and having the opportunity to raise Hines was enough for Colley-Lee. Freeman did not want any more children, so the arrangement worked for him as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After Freeman and Colley-Lee divorced in 2010, Freeman paid her an estimated $100-$200 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. Colley-Lee had asked for upwards of $400 million. Because of this, many believe that infidelity might have been the cause for the relationship to go south.</p><p>Colley-Lee went on to work in the entertainment industry. It is unclear what her relationship status is now.</p><p>Most recently, Freeman has been linked to film producer Lori McCreary. While the two have not publicly commented on their relationship, their red carpet appearances together could mean the relationship is serious. Fans of Freeman's will just have to wait and see how things unfold in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuuc6rnpqmXZu%2FprHMmqVmpZGnv6qxw2arqGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
