The only thing that I could do was make a call to the phone carrier,” she explains during a confessional, noting that she was told that Pedro turned off her phone.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Chantel-Pedro-Wants-Nothing-Do-With-Me-Amid-Phone-Drama.jpg><p>Pedro was on the other line at the time, but Chantel is unable to speak with him and resolve the matter. “He didn’t want to talk to me,” she says in the video, revealing that <a href=#>her estranged spouse</a> wants her to have “no access to the account or the phone number” amid their drama.</p><p>“It’s such bulls—t. He doesn’t want to communicate like adults,” the registered nurse confesses to the cameras. “In preparation or in completion of this divorce process.”</p><p>Chantel, <a href=#>who wed Pedro in March 2016</a>, also confides in her friend <strong>Destinee</strong> during the video, explaining that she is now questioning whether they were ever good together.</p><p>“I’m having a hard time believing that he ever loved me anymore,” <a href=#>the Georgia native</a> says while sitting beside her pal after their Panama getaway. Destinee chimes in, saying, “I just feel like he’s hit an all-time low. I don’t even recognize him anymore.”</p><p>Pedro, meanwhile, admits during a confessional that he “never thought this was going to happen between me and her.” The Dominican Republic native confesses that <a href=#>he feels “f—king broken” after their split</a> but that doesn’t stop him from cutting Chantel off of their joint phone plan.</p><p>Fans were first introduced to the TV couple on <a href=#>season 4 of 90 Day Fiancé</a> after Chantel met Pedro in his home country and they secretly got engaged.</p><p>Us confirmed in July that <a href=#>the duo split after six years of marriage</a>. According to court documents, the pair separated in April and one month later, Pedro filed for divorce. Chantel later filed her own divorce papers.</p><p>The estranged couple’s ups and downs have since played out on The Family Chantel. Their drama blew up during the August 29 episode of the TLC series after <a href=#>Pedro was accused of a “marriage scam” by Chantel’s family</a>.</p><p>“You asked me for my daughter’s hand in marriage. I thought it was gonna be [like] you’re all gonna grow old together,” Chantel’s father, <strong>Thomas Everett</strong>, told Pedro during an intense confrontation. “After four or five years, you all are growing apart. It seems like now it could be a marriage scam.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Pedro fired back: “Let me tell you something, sir, if you believe it was a marriage scam, I could have [gotten] my citizenship three years ago … I don’t care about citizenship.”</p><p>The Family Chantel airs on TLC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqhmZ6psq15zqdkn5mdnrm6ecKhmKeslaF6sbHDq6Zmr5GjwbR5zairoaGenHq1u4ydpmavmam1brnEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
