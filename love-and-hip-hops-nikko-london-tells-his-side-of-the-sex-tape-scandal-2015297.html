Last month, though, Mimi told Us that after some persuading by Nikko (who said that their lovemaking was “like art,” she claims!),&nbsp;<a href=#>the couple made the film and shopped it around</a>.</p><p>Nikko has his own thoughts on the matter.</p><p>While Mimi has said in the past that Nikko is an “opportunist,” he says that they both used each other. “She needed me just like I needed her,” he tells Us.</p><p>Nikko claims that during their relationship, Mimi was still “torn” about her ex-boyfriend <strong>Stevie J</strong> and felt like she was “losing to the other woman” — Stevie J’s new companion, <strong>Joseline Hernandez</strong>. Nikko and Mimi were gunning for a spot on the show’s next season, so “we talked about how we can both stay relevant,” he admits.</p><p>Nikko says that he volunteered to take the blame for the tape since Mimi has a daughter. However, he feels that it’s unfair for Mimi to “keep crushing [his] image” — especially since he says Mimi had an equal part in their decision.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Mimi Faust and Nikko Smith" width=467 height=434 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Though the two aren’t on the best of terms, Nikko promises that he won’t release more footage — yes, there’s more! — and says that he still has respect for his ex, whom he calls a “great woman.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I have to thank her for…bringing me on the show,” he tells Us. “But other than that, there’s nothing else she really helped me with. I helped her with everything.”</p><p>Watch the video above for more of Nikko’s revelations, and tune in to VH1’s Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta on Mondays at 8 p.m. ET!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOorpVirq%2BwjKGgqWWYpL20ec2ioqSnXaG8r7DOp2StnZyhwG60yKxkrKGUmnqwsoytn55lo5rFbsDAqZxmq5OWu6Wty2ZpaWllZ4Z4ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
