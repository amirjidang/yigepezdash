Before, if you were to interview me I’d be like, ‘Show me your questions.’ I’d be the protector of the group that comes in there and go, ‘Hold on a minute.’”</p><p>Mel B noted that her tendencies could be “a bit too feisty or scary” — which is why she thinks her moniker is perfect for her.</p><p>“So that name was given and I love it. Just for the plain fact that I’m a bit scary, and I’ve got larger than life hair and that’s just me.” she said. “In this day and age, somebody would have taken offense by that. But I don’t take offense by it. Whether you’re black, white, mixed, there’s a bit of ‘Scary’ in all of us.”</p><p>The Spice Girls — a.k.a Mel B, <strong>Victoria Beckham</strong> (Posh Spice), <strong>Geri Halliwell</strong> (Ginger Spice), <strong>Melanie Chisholm</strong> (Sporty Spice) and <strong>Emma Bunton</strong> (Baby Spice) — formed in 1994. The group went on to have several hit songs, including <a href=#>1996’s “Wannabe”</a> and were beloved by fans for their differing stage personas.</p><p>Mel B recalled the group receiving their names from a journalist who “couldn’t be bothered to remember [their] full names” — and the monikers stuck.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Mel-B-Doesnt-Think-She-Could-Be-Scary-Spice-Today-4.jpg><p>“He just named us off the rack like that, and we were all like, ‘Oh God, I quite like my name,’” she said.</p><p>Mel B added that each individual’s name was not just a character they put on, but was instead <a href=#>fitting for their personality.</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It’s funny because to this day, Emma loves pink, and if she can have her way, she’d put her hair in ponytails,” she said. “Mel C will never get out of a tracksuit, and she always has her hair in a ponytail. Victoria is very sleek and elegant. Geri, she’s gone through a bit of a change, but she’s still that vicious Union Jack girl underneath her being the lady of the manor, let me tell you.”</p><p>She continued, “So we’re all exactly the same. Which is lovely considering we started when we were 17, 18, 19 and we’re now 48, 49, 50.”</p><p>In January, Mel B <a href=#>exclusively teased to Us Weekly</a> that “all five” members of the group might be reuniting soon, saying, “All I can say officially is we will be doing an announcement soon and the fans are going to be very happy. That is all I can say, but I can’t wait to say more.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSepF2XeqW7xKylrWWknbavt4ysn55lk6TCrbCMm5xmq5OWv7p50qmgnJ1dqbylrdho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
