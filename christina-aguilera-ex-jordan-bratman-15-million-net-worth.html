She's <a href=#>worth a staggering $100M more</a> than pop princess Britney Spears (due in part to the controversies Britney's dealt with, of course) and seems to have amassed her wealth almost effortlessly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But not everything in Christina Aguilera's world is as picture-perfect as her bank account.</p><p>In 2011, her divorce from her ex-husband Jordan Bratman was finalized, though Aguilera seemed to have moved on before the ink was dry. Either way, Christina Aguilera's net worth didn't take a hit when the pair separated, which left fans wondering how well-off her ex was.</p><p>What is Christina Aguilera's ex's net worth, and did he siphon some change off the singer before they split?</p><h2 id=what-does-jordan-bratman-do-for-a-living>What Does Jordan Bratman Do For A Living?</h2><p>Jordan Bratman is a somewhat well-known music executive who earned some credit for sourcing super-talented folks for his record label. He's been in the industry since the '90s, and apparently has a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">history</a> with artists like TLC, Boyz II Men, Madonna, Michael Jackson, and even P!nk (even though <a href=#>Christina once feuded with the star</a>).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to pin down his exact job duties, though; Jordan doesn't seem to have ever sat down for an interview that wasn't directly related to his then-wife's career. Yet he apparently built up his own wealth separate from what Christina was working on while they were together.</p><h2 id=what-is-christina-aguilera-39-s-ex-39-s-net-worth>What Is Christina Aguilera's Ex's Net Worth?</h2><p>Unfortunately for the music exec, Jordan Bratman's biggest claim to fame is being Christina Aguilera's ex-husband. Though he has quite the reputation in the industry, it's understandable that Bratman's professional life (and earnings) were overlooked in favor of his popstar diva wife's notoriety.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But after the two split, and publications separated their reported net worths, some people thought a bit more highly of Jordan. His net worth is a reported $15 million, and given the gap between what he's worth and what his ex is, it seems pretty clear that Jordan wasn't after Christina for her cash.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Voice Isn't The Only Thing That Bumped Christina Aguilera's Net Worth To $160 Million</a></span></p><p>Christina Aguilera's net worth is a whopping ten-plus times more than Bratman's, which suggests that they kept their finances fairly separate while they were married. But could there be more to the net worth story, including some large settlement upon the former couple's divorce?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-jordan-bratman-get-money-from-christina>Did Jordan Bratman Get Money From Christina?</h2><p>At first glance, it does seem like Christina Aguilera and Jordan Bratman separated pretty amicably. Christina even said in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interviews</a> that she was "torn about splitting [their] family up," but that things were "unhealthy and unhappy" for both her and Bratman before their separation.</p><p>It sounded mutual, even though Christina is technically the one who filed for divorce. Yet when it came time to settle their divorce, legally speaking, what wound up happening with the couple's assets?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Does Christina Aguilera Still Talk To Her Former Disney Co-Star, Justin Timberlake?</a></span></p><p>Hardly anyone seems to really know. At the time, TMZ<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that "sources connected with Jordan" stated that Christina's ex received some amount of cash in a settlement. This news was paired with the fact that Jordan, Christina, and Christina's then-new boyfriend (Matt Rutler) had previously been living together for some length of time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Is Why Christina Aguilera Felt ‘Insecure’ At The Peak Of Her Career</a></span></p><p>Jordan ultimately left the family home, though very few details were revealed either by TMZ or anyone else. However, the source did confirm that the couple had a prenup that protected Christina Aguilera's assets and ensured that she didn't massively lose out cash-wise.</p><h2 id=is-jordan-bratman-still-working-in-the-industry>Is Jordan Bratman Still Working In The Industry?</h2><p>If Jordan Bratman did get a cut of Christina Aguilera's cash, he's kept pretty quiet about it. He's also kept his head down and continued working in the music industry. The Richest notes that Jordan <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">started working</a> in music marketing early on, and he's worked with recording artists and as a consultant for big-name companies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time he met Christina in 2002, his career was already soaring, even if it did take him longer to build up his $15M net worth while Christina was amassing more than ten times that amount. Other sources suggest that Jordan also has various investments, including a multi-million dollar property he sold after the divorce and some entrepreneurial pursuits.</p><p>It does make sense that someone in such a creative industry would have multiple sources of income, especially since Jordan's seen how much his ex-wife built her net worth with not just music, but other creative endeavors.</p><p>And it's pretty clear he probably wasn't ordered to pay child support for their son Max, since Christina makes so much more than him.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Here's Why Christina Aguilera Refused To Change Her Last Name For Fame</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaqZqMGqusBmmKCtmaGys62Mnq9mop%2BnsaK6jJupmqydlrtufZRmpKKknJ68r3nNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
