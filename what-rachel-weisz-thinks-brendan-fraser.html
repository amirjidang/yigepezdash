Not only were they filming one of the biggest hits of the late 90s, during the height of Brendan's fame, but the working conditions were also pretty rough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The crew actually traveled to Morocco for filming, spending some time in the Sahara desert to capture the dustiest and driest of shots. From sandstorms to dehydration risks to not-so-mummified creepy crawlies, the set of The Mummy was an intense place to be at the time.</p><p>Not only that, but Brendan Fraser's hard-hitting stunts in the first couple of films are what led to <a href=#>him ducking out of acting for a while</a>. And in the years since Rachel quit the franchise, it ultimately wound down after her departure: <a href=#>it seems like Brendan and Rachel haven't really kept in touch</a>.</p><p>Which leads fans to wonder, what does Rachel really think of her former co-star?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on December 26, 2022:</strong> Earlier in 2022, Brendan Fraser recalled a conversation he had with Rachel Weisz prior to The Mummy's release. He stated, "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When the movie was gonna come out</a> we had no idea what it was gonna be. Is it comedy? Is it an action picture? Is it an adventure, romance, all of it, none of it? I can still hear Rachel going, ‘Oh no they’re going to confiscate our equity cards.’ What does that even mean? Did we do it wrong? Did we chew up the scenery too much? I know I did."</p><p>Fraser also reported that despite the injuries he sustained during the first film of the franchise, he would be happy to come back for a fourth The Mummy movie.</p><h2 id=what-has-rachel-weisz-said-about-brendan-fraser>What Has Rachel Weisz Said About Brendan Fraser?</h2><p>Though there doesn't seem to have been rumors about a love triangle of any sort on set, fans can't help but wonder whether Rachel and Brendan were closer than just being cast mates. As far as anyone could tell, Rachel was single at the time of filming.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Brendan Fraser Been Doing Since 'The Mummy'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>And she did have some specific thoughts about Brendan at the time, which she revealed in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a pretty relatable interview</a>. What was really intriguing about the 2001 interview is that Rachel was chatting with a journalist she'd already met before.</p><p>In fact, the reporter, Emma Forrest, had nearly stalked Rachel when she worked in theater. Then, when Weisz earned some fame, she reconnected with the journalist who'd long followed her career.</p><p>Forrest chatted with Weisz on the set of The Mummy II, so the pair were clearly comfortable with one another when Rachel spilled her thoughts on Brendan.</p><p>And she did get pretty real, describing Brendan's physical appearance as very "adult film worthy." Clearly, she finds Brendan very attractive -- or at least she did about 20 years ago.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rachel-weisz-thought-brendan-fraser-was-a-total-babe>Rachel Weisz Thought Brendan Fraser Was A Total Babe</h2><p>Weisz thought Fraser was so hunky, she described him as being "massive," "muscular," and went on to describe his thighs. Not only was he great looking on film, explained Rachel, but the costumes were "really sexy," she pointed out -- though "jodphur-y trousers with big boots" don't really sound that appealing to most.</p><p>It's almost humorous the way Weisz described her co-star at the time, but the truth is that most people watching The Mummy films could probably relate to the actress near-drooling over him.</p><p>And 20 years later, it's probably nice for Brendan to finally hear the compliments!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Brendan Fraser Lost His $45 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2Bir8eeo2avlZ7Au3nToaCno6Nir7OxzZ2Yp2WWp660sdFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
