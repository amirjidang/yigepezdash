During the call, the royal couple called back to some of their favorite on-screen moments together, ranging from infamous ones to celebratory ones.</p><p class=p3>Booker – “There’s been a lot of good matches and we’ve had a lot of fun, but it would probably be The Boogeyman at WrestleMania because my wife got the worms.” [laughs]</p><p class=p3>Sharmell – “That wasn’t fun for me!”</p><p class=p3>Booker – “The Rey Mysterio match when I won the World Heavyweight Championship, that was a great night for us. My mother-in-law was sitting there about three rows back and even got a shot in the poster, but it was a great night for us because we had so much fun. We captured the World Heavyweight Championship and ruled the SmackDown kingdom like no one else before us or after us. The King and Queen—King Booker and Queen Sharmell—will go down as the greatest duo that came from the King Of The Ring [tournament] and it will go down in history in the annals of time. It was a great time in my career.”</p><p class=p3>Sharmell – “Same here. Memorable moments, definitely WrestleMania with Boogeyman and a mouth full of worms, I never thought I would see myself with that. [laughs] Kurt Angle, that was a great one, but definitely the favorite was Booker and Rey Mysterio with Booker winning the championship. It’s been an amazing ride.”</p><p>Beginning Next Sunday, October 18th, fans can tune in and watch the event&nbsp;(recorded on October 10)&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>Reality of Wrestling’s official YouTube</a>&nbsp;channel.</p><p>Booker T’s title win over Rey Mysterio can be seen in full below; we’ve also added a few other full-length matches to the list below that feature some of Booker’s biggest title matches in WWE.</p><p><br>WWE RAW — July 30, 2001</p><p><br>WWE SummerSlam — August 19, 2001</p><p><br>WWE The Great American Bash —&nbsp;July 23, 2006</p><p><br>WWE SummerSlam — August 26, 2007</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZFpbWxoYWKvsLvKnqlmrF2otaK%2BzJ6jpWWWlsOwvsitnGaqn66urXnMqKSepqRir7C7xp6wppme</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
