Despite any criticism they have faced, including <a href=#>NFL fans saying Swift is bad luck</a>, the couple has remained strong.</p><p>And, if there is any truth to the childhood song many of us grew up singing... "First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby in the baby carriage," with engagement rumors in full swing,<a href=#> a baby announcement might not be that far away for Traylor.</a> In the following, we look at why fans are saying Taylor Swift's pregnancy may happen in 2024 and whether or not the pop star wants kids.
