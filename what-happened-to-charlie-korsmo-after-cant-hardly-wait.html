By all accounts, Charlie could have continued on in Hollywood with relative ease. But there's a specific reason why he ducked out of the industry, though it doesn't have anything to do with other child stars' reasons for leaving the limelight.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">This Is What Darla From 'The Little Rascals' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><p>Two years after 'Can't Hardly Wait' came out, Charlie Korsmo finished up a college degree. Clearly, his reasons for leaving acting in the dust were purely professional. He earned a bachelor's in physics, but that wasn't all. A few years later, he earned his Juris Doctor from Yale. In 2007, he became a lawyer in New York.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That's a big jump for a kid actor who started out in Robin Williams' shadow!</p><p>But his career didn't stop at working as a lawyer in NYC. Korsmo went on to&nbsp;serve in some pretty illustrious positions. He's spent time working for a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals, worked for the EPA, and worked for the U.S. House of Representatives.</p><p>And after&nbsp;all that, Korsmo was nominated to President Obama's trustee board for an education foundation.</p><p>Currently, Charles Korsmo is a law professor, says the Case Western Reserve University School of Law's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. Professor Korsmo deals in corporate law, notes the site, and has worked for other universities before, too.</p><p>Of course, Charlie hasn't&nbsp;totally ditched his Hollywood roots. In 2019, the movie 'Chained for Life' emerged on the independent film circuit, and Korsmo had a headlining role. He portrayed 'Herr Director,' and earned critical acclaim for it, noted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Case</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Charlie explained, the film's writer/director,&nbsp;Aaron Schimberg, is an old friend of his. So when Schimberg called him and said 'I have a role for you,' Korsmo was up for the challenge. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Like other '90s stars, Korsmo may not be as famous as before</a>, but he still has connections in the industry.</p><p>Though he's said that he wouldn't give up his current profession to return to acting full-time, he's also not averse to taking on projects that work with his schedule. As&nbsp;The Daily Case noted, Charlie explained his feelings on heading back to the "artistic outlet" after so many years: "Acting is something I enjoy that maybe I didnâ€™t realize I missed so much."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Whatever Happened To The Child Star From 'Stuart Little'?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bq%2FHmqmloZViuLC%2B0qamZpmWqbKzecKapa1lmJa%2FpbjYZq6aoaRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 VlogJam - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_3.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
