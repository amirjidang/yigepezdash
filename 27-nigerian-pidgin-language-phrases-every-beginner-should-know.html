Pidgin in Nigeria is well accepted among people of different classes, ages, and ethnicities. It is often used as a language to bridge the gap that other Nigerian languages may come with. Pidgin is used in many day-to-day activities in Nigeria, including an exchange in the marketplace, places of worship, music, and media, among others.</p><p>Generally, pidgin is a language made up of lexicons and other features from more than one language. Typically with easy grammar and a reduced vocabulary than the languages from which it is derived and used among people who do not share a common language (i.e., lingua franca) for communication. Also, Pidgin English speakers maintain their own languages for conversation purposes within their own people. This is no exception in Nigeria.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-nigerian-pidgin-language-originated></span><strong>How Nigerian Pidgin Language Originated</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Nigerian pidgin started during the pre-colonial era in the 17th century. The language was developed to foster communication between British slave traders and the locals. Following the colonial area, it became more dominant between the British and their indigenous staff, and at the turn of independence, the language continued to grow. Alternating from a reference to the uneducated and rather used as a show of national identity.</p><p>The Nigerian pidgin, like any other pidgin, borrows words and language structure of indigenous languages. For example, I wan chop&nbsp;(I want to eat). Many Nigerian languages describe eating in the same manner as chopping (cutting into pieces). Also, many Nigerian languages omit the preposition ‘to.’ This influences an instance such as I wan go market (I want to go to the market).</p><p>In the history of Nigerian pidgin, words were borrowed from many indigenous languages. For instance, Walahi (sincerely – Hausa), obodo oyibo (white man’s land – Igbo), Koro (short cut, dark alley, or dirt road – Isoko), Una (plural of you (from unu) – Igbo), and Abi (Right – Yoruba). Similarly, many Nigerian languages have reduplication, which has been infused into the pidgin language. For instance, di food burn well well (The food really got burnt), I fit die now now&nbsp;(I can die immediately), di money don finish kia-kia (The money has finished quickly-quickly).</p><p>In recent times, Pidgin English usage among the youths has boosted the vocabulary content, and it is widely spread through pop culture, music, comedy skits, and movies, among others. The new generation slangs in Nigeria have opened the Nigeran Pidgin to numerous short trending phrases and expressions that bear little importance to the wider population but can form the entire basis of a conversation among young Nigerians.</p><p>The advancement in urbanization and national integration has fostered the spread of the Pidgin English language beyond the local/rural communities, into big cities, and even outside the country. As a nation composed of over 500 different languages, Pidgin English gives a means of understanding among the country’s people. Therefore, on a broad view, it is spoken in all geopolitical zones with documented statistics showing a higher use in the oil-rich South-South regions such as Warri and Sapele. Also, it is common among Eastern trading regions, including Onitsha, Aba, Umuahia, and notably in use in Port Harcourt, Lagos, and Benin City.</p><p>The Nigerian pidgin has a huge acceptance in Nigeria and other countries outside of the country. Due to this, many words that originate from the Nigerian pidgin have found their way into the Oxford English Dictionary. Some of these words include sef (used to emphasize a preceding statement), chop-chop (one who eats a lot, embezzles, or mishandles), and gist (chat/gossip), among others.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=nigerian-pidgin-phrases-every-beginner-should-know></span><strong>Nigerian Pidgin Phrases Every Beginner Should Know</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=1-how-you-dey-how-body></span><strong>1.</strong><strong> How You Dey?/ How Body?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This translates to how are you in English.</p><p><strong>Appropriate responses would be either of the following:</strong></p><ul><li>I dey fine</li><li>I full ground/I gallant</li><li>I dey kampe</li><li>Body dey inside cloth (lit. means I’m still wearing clothes but translates to I am fine)</li></ul><p>The responses mean I am fine, or I am very fine.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=2-how-far></span><strong>2.</strong><strong> How Far?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This does not directly mean asking a question to know the distance of a place as in standard English language but has a wide range of meanings that include:</p><ul><li>Hi/hello</li><li>How are you?</li><li>How is your day going?</li><li>What’s the progress?</li><li>Shall we?</li><li>What’s the update?</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=3-you-too-much></span><strong>3.&nbsp;You too much&nbsp;</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This translates to</p><ul><li>you have done well</li><li>good job</li><li>you are kind</li><li>thank you</li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=4-ah-begabeg></span><strong>4.&nbsp; Ah beg/Abeg</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This translates to ‘please’ or asking for a request in standard English.

Na lie!</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>This is often used to show that what someone says is a lie or a big surprise when you hear something stunning. The facial expression and accompanying hand gestures differentiate both scenarios.</p><p>A similar expression here is No be lie! which translates to show agreement, concur with what another person is telling you, or express a mutual opinion.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=10-notin-spoil></span><strong>10.
