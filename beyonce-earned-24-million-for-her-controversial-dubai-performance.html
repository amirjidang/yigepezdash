Not only was the pop star decked out in millions of dollars in jewelry and accompanied by a full stage of performers, but the concert ended with a lavish fireworks display.</p><p>Atlantis The Royal Hotel is now one of Dubai’s most luxurious hotels. It has over 700 rooms, and a variety of lavish features, including the world’s largest jellyfish aquarium. It also has 17 restaurants and bars for guests to enjoy.</p><p>Beyonce didn’t only receive huge compensation for the performance; she was also treated like royalty and put up in one of the hotel’s most luxurious penthouses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With over 12,000 square feet of living space, the <a href=#>penthouse rents for $100,000 per night</a>.

It’s speculated this is because the album is interpreted to have many references to the Black and Queer community.</p><p>Nonetheless, the pop star never directly commented on the controversy.</p><p>Beyonce isn’t the only singer to receive a million-dollar paycheck for a single performance, though hers may have been the costliest.
